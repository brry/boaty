The British [NERC](https://nerc.ukri.org/) decided in 2016 to let the public 
vote on the name for their new polar research vessel 
([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRS_Sir_David_Attenborough#Naming_poll)).  
No way that could go wrong...

Anyway, I pulled the data from the vote with an 
[R script](https://github.com/brry/boaty/blob/master/Boaty.R)
and arranged it into an 
[excel file](https://github.com/brry/boaty/raw/master/Boaty.xlsx).  
RRS stands for Royeal Research Ship, by the way...  
I also selected my personal top 170 humorous entries:
