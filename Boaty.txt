Henry Worsley                 | 15774|1    |Sc2mSQMz|Bernie Jones         |I think we should name the new polar ship after the polar explorer who died in his solo attempt to cross Antarctica. His hero was Ernest Shackleton (the name of one of our ships). Also rather interestingly, he was a distant relative of Frank Worsley who was the captain of the ship Endurance which was used on the failed mission just over a century ago. It was also Frank Worsley who successfully helped steer the modified lifeboat James Caird to South Georgia to get help and rescue the others left behind on Elephant Island. Henry Worsley was trying to raise funds for the Endeavour Fund which helps wounded, injured or sick ex-service men achieve their ambitions in the field of sport or adventurous challenges. In my mind, Henry Worsley showed British pioneering spirit, grit and determination.

Pillar of Autumn              |  5823|0    |OeDXtffK|Havelock Vetinari    |The name is a reference to a ship from the popular science fiction franchise Halo.

Besides, the name has a hauntingly poetic ring to it.

Honor Frost                   |   690|1    |1y97J0Ay|Suzanne Birch @trowelblazers|Honor Frost was a pioneer in underwater exploration and marine archaeology. Though much of her work was in the Mediterranean rather than polar, she contributed to the application of scuba for science, the advancement of underwater research in general, and through her estate, the Honor Frost Foundation to this day continues to fund marine archaeology. Then there is the play on words-the connotation of Honor for the ship's character, and Frost...well, it is a polar vessel.

Captain John Stones           |   248|0    |X0ZUQgYl|Hannah Stones @HannahStones1|Captain John Stones was my grandfather and was in the RFA (Merchant Navy). Unfortunately he died yesterday (16\/03\/2016). However, in such a sad time I thought even more about his contribution to my research. I am a PhD researcher with the Institute of Maritime Law at the University of Southampton (and my work is inter-disciplinary with the engineering department under the Leverhulme Trust). This then led me to consider the role of seafarers more broadly in relation to research - whether they inspire us, provide an opportunity to develop a new technology, raise concerns that need to be solved, or man our ships. Although in the grand scheme of things Captain John Stones is one man who inspired one person, he represents all seafarers and it is important that their contribution is recognised. RRS Captain John Stones would recognise one great man, and seafarer, and the role that he knew that 'simple sailors' (as he referred to himself) provide in research.

Dr John Rae                   |   246|1    |tleMpIVL|Barbara Watt         |John Rae (30 September 1813 - 22 July 1893) was a Scottish doctor who explored parts of Northern Canada, found the final portion of the Northwest Passage (Rae Strait, named after him) and reported the fate of the Franklin Expedition. In 1846-47 he explored the Gulf of Boothia northwest of Hudson Bay. In 1848-51 he explored the Arctic coast near Victoria Island. In 1854 he went from Boothia to the Arctic coast and learned the fate of Franklin. He was noted for physical stamina, skill at hunting and boat handling, use of native methods and the ability to travel long distances with little equipment while living off the land. His name should go down in history. All the Orcadians including myself would be so proud to see this ship called after him. Please, please make it the Dr John Rae.

John Cockcroft                |   145|0    |gLDJvnNl|Daniel lopez         |Sir John Douglas Cockcroft was a British physicist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for splitting the atomic nucleus with Ernest Walton, and was instrumental in the development of nuclear power. As director of the AERE, he famously insisted that the coolant discharge chimney stacks of the Windscale plutonium production reactors be fitted, at great expense, with high performance filters. Since this was decided after the stacks had been designed, they produced iconic lumps in the shape of the structures. The reactors were designed to remain clean and uncorroded during use, thus it was not considered that there would be any particulate present for the filters to catch. These filters were therefore known as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the two reactors famously caught fire in the Windscale fire of 1957, and the filters prevented the disaster from becoming a catastrophe.

Dunbar emigrated to Canada in 1947, where she studied Arctic sea ice and polar navigation. Despite her expertise, her application to act as a research scientist on a Canadian icebreaker in 1954 was rejected-Naval vessels would not take a woman. Eventually she won permission to join a transport department icebreaker. During her life Dunbar acted as an observer in the first Arctic trials of hovercraft, was involved in testing supertanker use in ice, and was the Canadian coordinator of the first successful attempt to evaluate satellite photography for ice reconnaisance. She was awarded the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's Massey Medal for 'her excellent work in arctic geography and sea ice' and is the only woman to have won the medal. Dunbar paved the way for women in polar science to continue to break barriers, and represents successful collaboration with other nations whilst still being proud of her heritage. http:\/\/bit.ly\/1gYl6nA.

Given what evidence of climate degradation already reveals in earth's ecosystems and physical traits, this ship will likely be a buoy of hope for scientists and humanity that the evidence it reveals will rise above political rhetoric and contribute to solutions and decisions that help world leaders tack a new course of unanimous climate action. The results of which, at that time, this ship's scientists will be able to measure. As the submitter of this great ship's name, I hope the results of science revealed over this ship's lifetime, during my lifetime, will record the eventual stabilization of Earth's climate, perhaps even showing a reversal of man's damage. My, and humanity's, hope for this ship is that our unified responsible actions to reduce our impacts on the climate will be measurable and significant as seen by RRS Climate Hope's scientists.

Hardy served as zoologist on the RRS Discovery's voyage to explore the Antarctic between 1925 and 1927. On the voyage he invented the Continuous Plankton Recorder; it enabled any ship to collect plankton samples during an ordinary voyage. The CPR he created is still running today- showing his genius back in the day. It is now an instrument which has the widest geographic spread of the world allows plankton to be continuously sampled. I think it would be a great honour to him to name the ship after him; and NERC are a large funder of the CPR survey so it relates nicely to their work too.

Charles Wyville Thomson       |    59|1    |Nk4N6HdA|Siddhi Joshi @seabedhabitats|Sir Charles Wyville Thomson (1830 - 1882) was a Scottish natural historian and marine zoologist. He served as the chief scientist on the Challenger expedition; his work there revolutionized oceanography and led to his knighthood and was one of the first marine biologists to describe life in the ocean depths. After studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Thomson lectured in botany at the University of Aberdeen (1850-51) and Marischal College (1851-52) but concentrated increasingly on zoology after his appointment to chairs of natural history at Cork and Belfast (1853-68), in Ireland. When he was appointed professor of natural history at Edinburgh (1870), Thomson had already turned his attention exclusively to the study of marine invertebrates. Aboard two deep-sea dredging expeditions north of Scotland (1868-69), he discovered a wide variety of invertebrate life forms&mdash;many previously believed extinct. http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/C-Wyville-Thomson

It harks back to the days of the early scientists like Charles Darwin for whom sea travel was essential for research and JM Turner who strapped himself to a mast in a storm to observe and later paint a new way of seeing. The name is short enough to enable a sister ship or replacement to take the name RRS Observer 2 and so on. There is also a possibility to work in partnership with The Observer newspaper to obtain funding and publicity for the ship's work.

James Caird                   |    57|0    |hbkuXTJo|Sam Pearce @realsampearce|Sir Ernest Shackleton attempted the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration between 1914-17 in the Endurance. The Endurance was encountered difficulties in the ice of the Weddell Sea and ended up sinking and stranding its crew on the Ice. Lifeboats were required to tranfer the crew to the relative safety of Elephant Island. One of three lifeboats, the James Caird, was selected as the strongest for the job to deliver Shackleton and five others to South Georgia, after an 800-mile journey, where Shackleton could mount a rescue of the rest of the crew. They were all returned home without loss of life. This journey is remembered as one of the great feats of endurance and embodies the qualities of resilience, adeventure and integrity that should be assosciated with a new ship of this kind. I think it would be an excellent name for this new research vessel, as well as something a bit different to Nimrod, for example, which, while appropriate,would seem more obvious.

MARY SHELLEY                  |    48|0    |SNw4DHlC|Tansy Robson @artemisapphire|Opening and ending in the Arctic, Mary Shelley's novel was one of the earliest and most evocative forays into the polar regions of this world. The novel, Frankenstein, was ground-breaking, a precursor to man's meddling with nature that we are seeing in the melting of our own polar ice caps, a global warming monster of our own creation. It seems fitting the author who originally warned us to consider the consequences of our own actions should be the name of the ship that helps us deal with those consequences. Moreover the writer was herself a trailblazer; a British female author stepping forward in a male dominated world to break new ground (or new ice...). Plus all the polar names being suggested are largely male, which is both annoying and somewhat unfair, particularly as the ship isn't.

At the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling we have suffered two great losses in 2013 and it would only be fair to honour two modern scientists who lead the way to a new field of research by naming the ship with their combined names. Katharine Giles was a great researcher and friend but her work had been initiated and supported by prof. Seymour Laxon, who promoted our group internationally with great success. I would strongly object to give a silly name to a research ship just because it sounds cool on facebook. Scientists can be considered outsiders and nerdies, but they have great passion in their work and I have hardly seen more dedication to sciences than what I could see in Katharine and Seymour.

Avalonia                      |    44|1    |R4nlyqTv|R I                  |Avalonia was a small, prehistoric continent which over the last 500 million years or so drifted thousands of miles north, starting from near the Antarctic Circle. After colliding and joining with other continents, it fragmented and one part of it ended up as the underlying rock of most of southern Britain (and of parts of neighbouring countries). RRS Avalonia would retrace this journey when sailing from Britain to the Antarctic. During the continent's history it experienced many changes in climate, sea level and flora and fauna, the kind of processes which the ship's scientists will study. Geologists named the ancient continent after Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, which is another of the continent's fragments, and which is one of the most important locations for pre-Cambrian fossils, representing the earliest known complex multicellular organisms. The peninsula itself was named in the 17th century after the Isle of Avalon, from Arthurian legend.

Henry Hudson                  |    36|0    |43roZYOr|Andrew Davidson      |Sir Henry Hudson was an English sea explorer and navigator, born in Devon, in the early 17th century. Hudson made several attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a prospective Northwest Passage via a route above the Arctic Circle. Hudson explored the region around New York metropolitan area while looking for a western route to Asia while in the employment of the Dutch E.I.C. He explored the river which eventually was named for him, and laid thereby the foundation for Dutch colonisation of the region. In the modern world, major changes to the ice pack due to climate change have stirred speculation that the passage may become clear enough of ice to permit safe commercial shipping for at least part of the year; This was actually achieved in 2007 when the Northwest Passage became open to ships without the need of an icebreaker. It just goes to show that over a relatively short period how much the world has globally changed and it denotes a large change in the global climate.

Crean was noted on many occasions for his selfless acts including a 35 mile solo walk across the Ross Ice Shelf to save Edward Evens (earning him the Albert Medal for Lifesaving) and possibly the most famous is the final journey on board the lifeboat James Caird and final 36 hour hike over the glaciers of South Georgia by Crean, Shackleton and Worsley to the Whaling station at Stromenss to raise help for the stranded crew of the ill fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Both Scott and Shackleton spoke highly of Tom Crean, with his expeditionary work having earned him 3 polar metals during his time.

He is also the longest serving Captain of RRS Discovery. Mike Harding devoted his career to seafaring before retiring. The greater part of his career he devoted to working for NERC. He has kept scientists, support staff and ships crews safe in the worlds harshest oceans. He concentrated his life's work on keeping people safe at sea in order that they could carry essential scientific research at sea looking after the worlds oceans. His spirit for adventure saw him working from the age of 16 as a seafarer until retirement. He has never sought out recognition or reward for his work but many who know him will consider it fitting that such an accolade be given to such a devoted Captain.
Marie Tharp                   |    26|1    |TDclzNSC|Andrew Yool @DrYool  |Marie Tharp (1920-2006) was an American geologist and cartographer who, jointly with Bruce Heezen, produced the first map of the global ocean floor, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. By highlighting submarine geology such as oceanic ridges, this map ultimately played a key role in the acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics by the scientific community. Tharp was also an oceanographic scientist at a time when the achievements of women were routinely downplayed or relegated to the acknowledgements sections of scientific papers (at best!), and naming NERC's new vessel after her will be one (small) step towards recognising the role of women - and diversity more generally - in science.

This ship will explore the open waters that were meant to be his home, instead this highly intelligent, 5400 kilo, apex mammal has spent over 30 YEARS forced to perform like a clown in a circus, for food, in a concrete tank. Tilikum, will never again swim free as nature intended, but by naming this ship Blackfish, it will take his name out on the high seas & beyond, where all ocean creatures belong. The RRS BLACKFISH can hopefully play a role in preserving threatened orca habitats, as well as teaching people that the only way to see whales & dolphins, is by observing them in their own environment, while inspiring future generations of marine biologists, explorers, conservationists etc! Please watch the movie BLACKFISH to see his heart breaking story. Thank you.

The qualities of being determined, focused, purposeful & outstandingly set on one's goals would perfectly symbolise the character, spirit and outlook of such a vessel and her crew. The Resolute of 1850 was a noble ship (interestingly, not a warship), used to search for previous Arctic explorers (Franklin) who seemed to have disappeared. She is especially interesting; after ice encircled her she was abandoned, but people of the US later returned her to our then Queen. Despite being broken up, her wood was used to make the iconic and famous desk that US Presidents often use in the White House's 'Oval Office' to this day. Since the end of WW2, the US & the UK have been close friends. I believe this is a fantastic opportunity to honor both the UK's rich history in exploration and science, as well as a great ally to our nation.

Celia Fiennes                 |    20|0    |DpnNWOiA|Elizabeth Farrell ElizaFx|Celia Fiennes was an English domestic explorer. She traveled around England on horseback between 1684 and 1703 recording her adventures in a journal that was still being reprinted until the 1990s . During her time, the idea of travelling for leisure or pleasure was still a brand new concept, there was no idea of domestic tourism in the UK and travel writing was largely unheard of . Of course, all of this was also doubly unheard of for a woman to do. So, in all these respects, she was a one person force of nature, the ultimate ice-breaker of her times. She made her 'Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall' in 1698 accompanied by 2 companions. Her travels continued until about 1712 and took her through most of England. All her notes were published in a travel memoir in 1702, intended for family posterity. The full text can be found by searching for 'Through England on a Side Saddle in the time of William & Mary'

Dr. John Rae                  |    17|1    |U6lN4aZw|Thomas Laverty       |John Rae was revolutionary in opening up the Northwest Passage through the polar regions and was one of the first explorers to adapt his style to the environment which through he travelled, adopting indigenous ways and working with the local peoples to succeed. He was respected by indigenous peoples and his colleagues alike for his ability to cope with extreme climates and arduous journeys. When he returned to the United Kingdom he was shunned and largely unrecognised by the establishment for maintaining his honesty and integrity in describing his knowledge of the fate of Shackleton's Expedition. As time has passed we have come to understand and respect John Rae more and it would be timely, and honourable, to recognise his achievements through the act of naming our flagship polar research vessel in tribute.

Born in Birkenhead He attended Calday Grange Grammar School then later Liverpool University and finally Cambridge where he became a Doctor of Glaciology. His First British Antarctic Survey expedition was with Sir Vivian Fuchsia aboard the Kister Dan- an early predecessor of the ship being built in Birkenhead. He went on many expeditions, measuring atmospheric change and movement and later melting of the ice cap resulting in him being presented with a polar medal by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Bob worked for BAS, the European Space Agency and NASA and became a world expert in his field of Climatology and Glaciology. He became a laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 as one of the experts on climate change invited by the lPCC to help with Al Gores campaign on Global Warming. My Uncle Bob sadly passed away last February and there is not enough space here to write all of the reasons that l think your ship should be named after him.

He was too modest to realize how far the strength both of leader and expedition depended upon the presence among the rank and file of men like himself and his comrades of the mess deck&rdquo;.

Forbes laid foundations for Darwin's evolution, Proudman's dynamic oceanography , Doodson's tides and Fitzroy's ocean weather forecast data. He died prematurely from overwork at age of 39! He corresponded with Darwin and recognized that Isle of Man has tropical and polar water just like the Galapagos and hence biodiversity.

Amundsen disappeared with his crew while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic. They were seeking missing members of another crew, whose airship had crashed while returning from the North Pole. The ship should be in honour of him for his great deeds. Also the ship is built for research in Antarctica and the Arctic so it should be named after Amundsen as he was a pioneer in the exploration of the Poles.

Ginny Fiennes was highly respected in polar circles around the world. In 1985, she became the first woman ever to be invited to join the hallowed ranks of the Antarctic Club, and, two years later, the first to receive the Polar medal from the Queen. Her Transglobe Expedition team became the first to reach both poles, to cross Antarctica and the Arctic Ocean, through the North West Passage- a journey altogether of 35,000 miles lasting three years. By naming the ship after Ginny would show that Britain supports equality and celebrates its heroines.

The phrase 'The Light of Dawn', for me, has something thru and thru positive ... Let me try to explane why: What is 'light'? Generally it is one of the sources of 'life'. It is also accociated as something warm. the mankind is always trying to reach for it: no matter if we are waiting for the summer, adoring that the night is coming or hey: we are trying to make ist artificial. But don't forget that it is also the opponent of some we also have in mind as a bad value: the Dark! Then the dawn: Where are so many phrase sounding like 'every dawn can be the beginning of something good'. And thats what it is - dawn is the beginning of a new day - which could be sure both: something good and something which ends up in chaos or tragedy - but at least the dawn stays for the sun (light), for have a sleep over something (german phrase) and so on (cap of characters reached)

Snow Ghost                    |    13|0    |a7k09j1n|Ivan Preston         |Snow represents the snowy places the ship will be operating around and Ghost offers a sense of fluidic and clam movement in otherwise difficult seas. The ship looks as though it is built to be a presence in places other ships would find difficult. Ghosts (fictional) are seldom portrayed as having boundaries or barriers to their smooth operation. As these type of ships are rare, a sense of the mythical seems appropriate.
This Girl Can                 |    13|0    |cCmFsWuD|Paul Derbyshire AKA_Arthur|Women are hugely under represented in culture where a choice is made between a male and a female figurehead or, for instance, even whether women are represented in society on bank notes. All the previously named ships have been named as male or been themed as male because males served on the original research expedition (i.e. Discovery). The 'This Girl Can' national campaign should be supported by the naming of this vessel to acknowledge that, whatever the challenges, women can. As a supplementary note, ships are made gender specific by being called 'she' and now is a good time that the naming of a Research Ship were to acknowledge this.

John Rae \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472|    12|0    |RtLMsjk5|Michael Richmond @mhr1711|The recurring suggestions for John Rae speak for themselves. I can think of nothing more appropriate than to endow this vessel with the spirit of John Rae. To allow all associated with the ship and it&rsquo;s work to be inspired by the skills, knowledge and achievements or this great explorer would hopefully set them on a course to emulate similar achievements. To break away from the Victorian sensibilities which prevented proper acknowledgement and celebration of John Raes&rsquo; achievements would signal a real commitment to knowledge, truth and understanding. My suggested names include RSS John Rae, RSS John Rae - Long Strider, RSS John Rae \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472 and RSS Long Strider. In the Inuktitut language of Northern Canada, John Rae was known as Long Strider and can be written using Canadian Aboriginal syllabics as the \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472 shown in one of my suggested names.

The entire crew survived the 2 year trek to Elephant Island, thanks in no small measure to the entertainment provided by Leonard Hussey. Another member of the crew, Orde-Lees, the motor expert and storekeeper, said this of him. &ldquo;Last night's concert was a great success. Hussey the indefatigable with his banjo and it really does as, as Sir Ernest said, supply brain food; not exactly intellectual food, but music hath charms altogether unique on Elephant island.

Parry's command on the highly succesful 1819 expedition to seek the Northwest Passage, achieving a furthest West that would not be beaten until 1910. She went on to perform 3 other arctic voyages of note, with Parry in command. There has not been a ship named Hecla since 1940, and it would be entirely appropriate given that the launch of the new ship is slated for 2019 that the bicentenary of its predecessors most famous voyage should be marked by bringing the name to life again.

I believe her ability to construct a reasoned argument based on analysis, logic, and fact reflect well against the mission of the new polar research ship. 'Molly' appears to have been a popular name for girls in her age bracket - births in the early 2000s. Naming a ship with a female name is traditional but I think naming the new ship 'Molly Alexandra' will resonate with many girls currently in education and encourage them to pursue goals in science, technology, (english) and maths (STEM) subjects. Perhaps it may even inspire future female polar researchers?

This was proof that the enormous ice sheet rests on water and not land. The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Greek &nu;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;\u03af&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina. The Nautilus is the fictional submarine captained by Nemo featured in Jules Verne's novels Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870) and The Mysterious Island (1874). Verne named the Nautilus after Robert Fulton's real-life submarine Nautilus (1800).
Aria                          |     8|0    |7hw8fHTZ|Petra Wolf @p_wolf62 |Aria as a female given name, Aria (\u05dc\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d4) means 'lioness' in Hebrew, or 'air' in Italian. It also refers to 'aria', a self-contained piece for one voice usually, most commonly found in the context of opera. So, the name symbolizes a force that can achieve something by itself as well as being part of a team. In times where part of research is to preserve the precious resources we have and in a nature friendly way, a female name is more appropriate that anything that suggests destruction or force.

In 1901, while serving on Ringarooma in New Zealand, he volunteered to join Scott's 1901-04 Discovery Expedition to Antarctica, thus beginning his exploring career. After his Terra Nova experience, Crean's third and final Antarctic venture was as second officer on Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, on Endurance. After Endurance became beset in the pack ice and sank, Crean and the ship's company spent months drifting on the ice before a journey in boats to Elephant Island. He was a member of the crew which made an open boat journey of 800 nautical miles (1,500 km) from Elephant Island to South Georgia, to seek aid for the stranded party. Crean's contributions to these expeditions sealed his reputation as a polar explorer, and earned him a total of three Polar medals. After the Endurance expedition, PLEASE READ WIKI PAGE

This led to him being shipwrecked on numerous occasions, one of which resulted in him along with an inuit crewmember undertaking an epic track across frozen seas to raise help for the surviving crew (The Ice Master). He is without doubt one of the greatest polar explorers yet one of the least known and should have joined Pearl at the North Pole in 1908 which would have raised his profile. By naming the ship after him we can recognise the tremendous achievements and contribution he made to polar exploration.

His work, numerous published reports and legacy still have vast implications on the world today.

The Archimedes principle that the buoyant force on a solid object is equal to the weight of the water displaced. Therefore the new Ship RRS Archimedes will float. The principle can also be applied to the icebergs that the new ship may encounter on its journey.

It is also a simple word, easily understood by all, which highlights the need for us all to help support research to understand and care for our environment. The exclamation mark which is essential and in the song title, emphasizes urgency. It should also be capitalised. Copyright permitting, there could be great opportunities for using the original song and associated semaphore images to create publicity around the ship, the science, and the scientists. (For info, my original idea was Yellow Submarine - but think there may have been conceptual problems with that one!)

They live in an undersea base called the Octopod, from where they go on adventures with a fleet of aquatic vehicles, and Captain Barnacles is the brave polar bear leader of the Octonauts. I think the polar ship should be named 'RRS Captain Barnacles' after him because Captain Barnacles' motto is 'Explore - Rescue - Protect' and that's what this new RRS ship will do too.

In his lifetime he studied meteorology and natural history of the polar regions, he wrote one of the most influential books on the Arctic at the time and for many years later (An Account of the Arctic Regions and Northern Whale Fishery, 1820). He mapped parts of the Greenland Coast, was a member of British Association for the Advancement of Science and Royal Society of Edinburgh. He deserves to be better known for all of his achievements (too many to list here), and he is a personal hero of mine. He would heartily approve and support the work carried out by NERC.

POLARIS                       |     7|0    |2nQ2jhJS|Rodrigo Pacheco-Ruiz |Polaris not only has a strong etymological relationship with the ice sheets on earth. It is also synonym of navigation and exploration since people took to sea. The importance of the star as a bearing aid during many millenia was a reassurance for those exploring new seaways as well as it was its brightness marking the way home. In my opinion, a research vessel under such name should inspire new generations of explorers and scientists to search for the uncharted regions of our knowledge without falling astray in the process.

William Parry                 |     7|1    |zTJnDTua|Dave Parry @DocPazz  |Rear Admiral Sir William Parry pioneered polar exploration and set one of the earliest records for human exploration farthest north, which stood for almost 50 years. Parry realised the importance of maintaining morale during long periods of darkness; the crew exercised regularly while officers performed plays and produced a newspaper. This spirit of camaraderie and leadership lives on within research. He placed great importance on crew welfare and was a leader in the use of canning for food preservation, also growing mustard and cress to help relieve scurvy. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821 and served as acting Hydrographer for the Navy. He described a number of plant species, disseminating his findings in the scientific literature. The pioneering exploration, dissemination of science and focus on welfare almost 200 years ago are in the best traditions of British polar research, so it would be a fitting tribute to name the new vessel RRS William Parry.

If I was reading a book to my 3 young children about a big boat that went on exciting voyages to the ends of the earth looking for new undiscovered things, I'd want it to have an inspirational name to help capture their imagination... after all, it starts with children, doesn't it?

John Rae - Long Strider       |     6|0    |Mp3MmS2I|Michael Richmond @mhr1711|The recurring suggestions for John Rae speak for themselves. I can think of nothing more appropriate than to endow this vessel with the spirit of John Rae. To allow all associated with the ship and it&rsquo;s work to be inspired by the skills, knowledge and achievements or this great explorer would hopefully set them on a course to emulate similar achievements. To break away from the Victorian sensibilities which prevented proper acknowledgement and celebration of John Raes&rsquo; achievements would signal a real commitment to knowledge, truth and understanding. My suggested names include RSS John Rae, RSS John Rae - Long Strider, RSS John Rae \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472 and RSS Long Strider. In the Inuktitut language of Northern Canada, John Rae was known as Long Strider and can be written using Canadian Aboriginal syllabics as the \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472 shown in one of my suggested names.

Also, Ursa Major is used as a marker to find the Pole Star, a feature which is very important for navigation, and therefore a highly appropriate name for any sea-going vessel.

The name 'Great Aurora' signifies a clearly UK ship which acts as the enabler of science and research, bringing a new light.

Cheesecake                    |     6|0    |sZQBsjfH|Daniel Williams      |The first &ldquo;cheese cake&rdquo; may have been created on the Greek island of Samos. Physical anthropologists excavated cheese molds there which were dated circa 2,000 B.C. Cheese and cheese products had most likely been around for thousands of years before this, but earlier than this goes into prehistory (that period in human history before the invention of writing) so we will never really know. In Greece, cheesecake was considered to be a good source of energy, and there is evidence that it was served to athletes during the first Olympic games in 776 B.C. Greek brides and grooms were also known to use cheesecake as a wedding cake. The simple ingredients of flour, wheat, honey and cheese were formed into a cake and baked - a far cry from the more complicated recipes available today! For these heritalogical and cultural reasons, we nominate this fine vessel to be called the RRS Cheesecake.

Resolution                    |     6|0    |zYDydSSR|Neville Hime @NHime2 |Resolution was the name of Captain Cook&rsquo;s flagship on his 2nd and 3rd voyages. Cook called her 'the ship of my choice, the fittest for service of any I have seen' (she was also British built in Whitby). No expense was spared in equipping her with the latest scientific devices, also very similar to the New Polar Research Vessel. Cook&rsquo;s Resolution is one of the greatest ships in the history of discovery and was probably the first vessel to cross the Antarctic Circle on Cook's 2nd voyage in 1773. She also crossed the Arctic Circle on Cook's 3rd voyage in 1778 so she is the first ship to have crossed both Polar Circles. Resolution is also a most appropriate aptitude for polar science at sea when the ship will be undertaking research in the most inhospitable waters in the world. This makes Resolution the most appropriate name for the new UK NPRV (also see http:\/\/www.captaincooksociety.com\/home\/detail?ArticleId=18).

Basically, if you aren't true, if you don't act like you feel, then you get Karma-justice, that's nature's way of paying you back'. Nature, the weather and the sea, can be cruel, unforgiving but also beautiful especially on the journeys this ship will take; the song gracefully represents all these tenets. I humbly submit that Boy George and Culture Club represent the very best of us and RRS Karma Chamaeleon will be able to remind us of that when sailing those cold and perilous seas; she will show what can be done with a little ambition and and a big dollop of fortitude.

NOAA's ARC                    |     5|0    |2NXkfDor|Will Ship willshipdesign@gmail.com|Because NOAA ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) have been instrumental in scientific research into our oceans and atmosphere and are the sister organisation of the NOC \/ NERC. Naming this vessel in honour of NOAA would help in furthering co-operation in scientific research goals and understanding, as well as marking our appreciation of their efforts. An ARC minute is one sixtieth of a degree and from the equator to either pole RRS NOAA's ARC would have travelled 5400 ARCminutes or 5400 nautical miles. NOAA's ARC could be considered the modern day equivalent of the biblical, two by two, Noah's Ark. Yet rather than taking just two of each species before the floods come, hopefully by taking two of each scientific instrument (built in redundancy) we can better understand our changing climactic environment and learn to prevent such catastrophe, through science and research.

Anthropolis                   |     5|0    |7a5QBZSv|Mark McGurnaghan     |I am suggesting this name for the following reasons. The meaning of ANTHROPOLIS is unknown. Since 'research' in itself is all about researching the unknown, I feel the name ANTHROPOLIS is a name worthy for such a vessel. Additionally the name ANTHROPOLIS has 11 letters. It has 4 vowels and 7 consonants. The 4 vowels would represent the four corners of the world - North , South, East and West. The 7 consonants would represent the seven continents of our planet. In choosing ANTHROPOLIS as the name for this ship the word ANTROPOLIS would no longer be unknown. When people speak of ANTHROPOLIS they would think RSS ANTROPOLIS .

Babel Fish                    |     5|0,5  |etFtrwXE|Victoria Ling        |The name comes from Douglas Adams' science fiction classic 'Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy' and I have two main reasons for suggesting this name. In the book, the Babel Fish (once placed in the ear) was able to immediately translate any language. In science we are constantly having to translate our research; whether it is translating meaning from masses of data, or whether it is translating our research into language that a lay audience can understand. The second reason for proposing this name is slightly broader - it is a nod to Hitchhiker's Guide, and that had the underlying philosophy that unless you ask the right questions (i.e. in both a research sense and in a philosophical sense) the answers will be meaningless. Science is as much about asking the right questions as it is digging around in data to find answers. As an additional, rather superficial point, babel 'fish' has an obvious aquatic resonance.

The fact that the name recognises the ships abilities to reach new areas of the Antarctic also acts as a metaphor for the progression of science as more is discovered about our poles, which is vitally important for us to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities on global climate, as well as to better understand the ecosystems that thrive in polar regions.

It has taught me a lot about marine life which I now love. They live in an undersea base called the Octopod, from where they go on adventures with a fleet of aquatic vehicles, and Captain Barnacles is the brave polar bear leader of the Octonauts. I think the polar ship should be named 'RRS Captain Barnacles' after him because Captain Barnacles' motto is 'Explore - Rescue - Protect' and that's what this new RRS ship will do too.

'Molly' appears to have been a popular name for girls in her age bracket - births in the early 2000s. Naming a ship with a female name is traditional but I think naming the new ship 'Molly' will resonate with many girls currently in education and encourage them to pursue goals in science, technology, (english) and maths (STEM) subjects. Perhaps it may even inspire future female polar researchers?

Enceladus                     |     5|0,4  |e4dDHgNH|Andy Evans @SevtaiOkami|Enceladus (pronounced \/\u025bn\u02c8s\u025bl\u0259d\u0259s\/) is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. It is 500 kilometers (310 mi) in diameter,[3] about a tenth of that of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Enceladus is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice, reflecting almost all the sunlight that strikes it, making its surface temperature at noon reach only &minus;198 &deg;C (&minus;324.4 &deg;F). Despite its small size, Enceladus has a wide range of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young, tectonically deformed terrains that formed as recently as 100 million years ago.

Therefore, I have chosen 'RRS Parhelia'. 'Parhelia' is the scientific name given to an an atmospheric phenomenon often seen in the polar regions. It consists of a pair of bright spots on either horizontal side on the Sun, often co-occurring with a luminous ring known as a 22&deg; halo. These bright spots are also known by the Arctic people as 'sun dogs' so it is a concept the local people are familiar with.

The changes to polar environment in which the ship operates will underscore this. It's also a nod to the irreverent ship names in the Culture series (such as 'A considerable lack of gravitas', 'What are the civilian applications?' and 'Problem child') by acclaimed Scottish science fiction writer Iain M Banks - acknowledging the role of science fiction in advancing the aspirations of science, and British pre-eminence in both. And it's an example of our classic British humour.

A truly extra-ordinary man. He was born ca. 1725 and died December 26th 1770. Using his name would be a recognition towards the Polynesian people who will probably be the most affected by sea-level rise. Maybe the spirit of Tupaia (also written Tupaea) can guide the world to a better and cleaner place.

But not only that, he was the only person on that expedition who had already been to Antarctica having been a member of the Carsten Borchgrevink expedition of 1898 to 1900 on the Southern Cross. Bernacchi has links with the region of Cammell Laird having lived (as a very young child) in Fallowfield in Manchester. The family then emigrated to Australia where he is regarded as the first Australian Antarctic explorer. After his return to the UK in 1904 he settled in the UK and stood as a parliamentary candidate in Widnes in the General Election of 1910. His diaries are held in the Scott Polar Research Museum in Cambridge. His book Saga of the 'Discovery' is a history of RRS Discovery, the first half dealing with Scott's expedition, and is based on Bernacchi's diaries, and the second half deals with the subsequent Antarctic expeditions of the ship.

The ship is going to be travelling all over the world covering great distance on an ambitious project which is why I went for voyager.

Pilgrim because the ship is on a long journey of discovery and in some ways it is a holy journey as you are experiencing and discovering things very few people will get to experience and these locations are are holy to people who are interetsted in wildlife and the conservation of such a delicate but diverse ecosystem. I find the name fitting as it represents the ships mission and the message it wants to spread to the world about how important out planet is.

Alice in Wonderland           |     4|0    |wo6Ymc85|Trottier Annie-Pier  |Alice in Wonderland is a classic in the british litterature. This novel was written in 1865 by Lewis Caroll and many adaptations of any kind were made to the cinema. This story about the journey of a girl discovering an other parallel world is highly related, in my sens, to this new research vessel. The Antarctica is a dream land were wild life meet extrem climatic conditions and it is a kind of Wonderland in the popular thinking. Alice in Wonderland could therefore relate to the ressearch vessel (Alice) discovering a new world far from the civilizations, such as Arctica and Antarctica. Moreover, feminin names should be provide for scientific ships since the girls place in science are still not well establish.

Odin's Sight                  |     4|0    |hkx8m7nL|Katy Macpherson      |According to Norse mythology, the Norse God Odin was ever questing for Wisdom. Mimir (a god or giant), whose knowledge of all things was unparalleled among the inhabitants of the cosmos, achieved this status by taking his water from the well, whose waters impart this cosmic knowledge. Odin requested a drink from the water in his quest for knowledge. Mimir would only comply if Odin was willing to trade his own eye. In his quest for knowledge Odin was willing to sacrifice his eye to gain another kind of sight. An interpretation of this story is that for those who share Odin's values, no sacrifice is too great for wisdom. I believe that this name would encapsulate the spirit of voyages she would undertake during her service time. Representing the sacrifices and hardwork the crew and scientists undertake in their quest for knowledge. Other suggestions would be Odin's Abyssal Sight, I have also made several more submissions based on this stories concept.

I understand that Scott described him as a 'giant worker' who was responsible for much of the major equipment on the trek to the pole and therefore a major contributor. He lies in an unknown location as of course does Captain Oates and like him for the most part forgotten maybe because he was a Petty Officer and not Captain or Lieutenant. I believe he should be remembered by naming a ship after him since he was also a member of the Royal Navy. My first choce would have been Captain 'Titus' Oates however on refelection I believe Petty Officer Edgar Evans a little more deserving.

He joined the Royal Navy from school and dedicated his life to Navy service. He sadly passed away just over 2 years ago after a short battle with Alzheimer's. He was held in extremely high regard by the RN and all who served with him. This would be a great tribute to him and his dedication to the RN and, in the later part of his career, his influential support of the Antarctic Survey Programme.

Nikolay Vavilov               |     4|1    |LsextoIG|Abigail Amey @abigailamey|Seed banks are widely recognised as an important safety net for world agriculture and food security, as demonstrated with the Svalbard 'doomsday' vault in Norway. Nikolai Vavilov pioneered seed collection and set up the first major seed bank in Leningrad in addition to many other banks dotted around the globe. He was a plant explorer and geneticist, who sought to end famine and recognised that seeds should be collected from the areas where a crop plant had first been domesticated. As his work was gaining wide recognition in the West, he died of starvation in one of Stalin's gulags. His brother, the physicist Sergey Vavilov, rose under Stalin to become head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The laws of physics were less politically charged than those of genetics. The Akademik Sergey Vavilov is an ocean voyager designed for polar research. It seems fitting that there should be a ship named after Nikolay to bring his story to a wider audience, and what could be better than yours?

Tir-far-th\u00f3inn           |     4|0    |YdJGoxas|Fiona Carmichael     |Terry Pratchett's character representing oneness with landscape (in this case, the chalk downs of southern England) over geological time has a name which he translates as Tir-far-th\u00f3inn, or Land Under Wave, in the language of his uber-Scots fairyfolk , the Nac Mac Feegles. As a young girl who inherits her grandmother's role as shepherdess, she experiences the Chalk as all the creatures which have gone to make it, and comes to recognise herself as its protector. She is a witch, which in Pratchett's world is someone who uses a mixture of common and uncommon sense to find out the little levers which will make people make the changes they need to, in order to get the 'magic' they seek. I think she would be an appropriate figure for a ship which will be exploring the many layers of the polar geography, oceanography and ecology, with a view, presumably, to understanding the mechanisms which will we hope will help us to change our behaviour and avoid global climate disaster.

She organised the first transnavigation of British Columbia, entirely by river; lived for two months with an Omani family, organised four expeditions with her husband to locate the lost frankincense city of Ubar in Dhofar; devised a plan to circumnavigate the world along its polar axis, and ten years later her Transglobe Expedition team became the first to reach both poles, to cross Antarctica and the Arctic Ocean, through the North West Passage. She was quite simply an amazing woman! Her maiden name was Pepper and I think that Ginny Pepper has a great ring to it. She was also the wife of Ranulph Fiennes.

This tells us to work together, and forget any differences between us for the purpose of scientific discovery. Because this ship is a reasearch vessel, it makes sense to name it after someone who played a very important part in a very important discovery. It could also be a good idea to name it after a less well known scientist than someone extremely well known like Newton, because it means that people can learn about them, and discover what they did.

In the time of Elizabeth 2 we have continued this ground breaking research and will continue to do so with this ship. Both Queen Elizabeth's are arguably the greatest monarch's we have had. Elizabeth 1 took the country from the ravages of her father's reign to something more stable and into the beginnings of a modern, scientific era. As a woman in the era a very notable achievement. Elizabeth 2 has equally achieved the distinction of taking us from the aftermath of a world war, through a remarkable period of change and modernity. Throughout her reign she has been a symbol of inclusion amongst growing social division. In her 90th year I feel it appropriate that we honour both Elizabeth 2 and Elizabeth 1. Exploration flourished under both.

Gaia's Quest                  |     3|0    |ot0SdjD0|Louis Hughes         |In Greek mythology, Gaia ,from Ancient Greek &Gamma;&alpha;\u1fd6&alpha;, a poetical form of 'land' or 'earth' was the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. This primal Greek Mother Goddess is the creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans, and the Giants were her children. The gods reigning over their classical pantheon were born from her union with Uranus (the sky), while the sea-gods were born from her union with Pontus (the sea) and because her name represents the whole eco system, the earth, the sky and the sea I think Gaia Quest would be to care for and nurture this planet earth.

It is also keeping alive old style names which would have been used on ships a part of that era. As an polar expedition ship it symbolises the modern technology on how far these types of ships have come, but keeping a close association with a heritage of Arctic exploration dating back centuries. To an age where science and discovery would develop pushing into new boundaries and change the way we know our planet today. Having such a name demonstrates the achievements of the ones who will build this ship and be able to send her out into the far reaches of the polar regions. A larger and newer ship will show the United Kingdoms contribution to Arctic Expeditions, something of which we have been involved in since the days of Robert Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton who pushed out new boundaries and became immortalised in the history of exploration.

Thomas 'Tom' Crean (Irish: Tom\u00e1s &Oacute; Croidhe\u00e1in; 25 February 1877 - 27 July 1938), was an Irish seaman and Antarctic explorer from Annascaul in County Kerry. He was a member of three major expeditions to Antarctica during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Captain Scott's 1911-13 Terra Nova Expedition. This saw the race to reach the South Pole lost to Roald Amundsen and ended in the deaths of Scott and his polar party. During this expedition, Crean's 35 statute miles (56 km) solo walk across the Ross Ice Shelf to save the life of Edward Evans led to him receiving the Albert Medal for Lifesaving.

Attenborough Polar Quest      |     3|1    |IiUlUPqu|Alan Burrows         |Sir David Attenborough has contributed so much as a naturalist and broadcaster that it would seem obvious if not fitting that as this man enters his ninetieth year that this honor should be bestowed upon him. This modest man has a such a great interest in the natural world and is greatly concerned for the well being of our planet. With his documentary works on television such as 'Life on Earth', 'The Living Planet', 'Trials of Life', etc. he has informed so many people about the importance of the life that we occupy the earth with. So the first two parts of the name are quite obvious, Quest as the last part of the name is selected for two reasons. First the word quest means search; expedition or undertaking with the purpose of achieving, which seems appropriate to the ships remit and secondly the word quest refers back to Sir David Attenborough because his famous television series of the 1950s which was called 'Zoo Quest'. In conclusion this would be an ideal tribute to this man.
Arethusa                      |     3|0    |hMGkPX4K|Daniel Woodward @deedubbleyoo|https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180217185619\/https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arethusa_(mythology) Arethusa was a Nymph of greek mythology. She is deeply and intimately connected to water , and in her chase from Alpheus, travelled across the world, in the sky and under the sea. She was, in effect the living embodiment of the water cycle, touching all life. She is often depicted as a young woman surrounded by dolphins, what better name for a ship that will study the aquatic world in a hunt for knowledge. On a personal note, my father served in the Royal Navy for over 20 years. His last ship was the HMS Arethusa (F38), and it was a ship he remembered with great fondness. I would dearly love the name Arethusa to take to the sea again, especially in the capacity of furthering science, knowledge and understanding.
MILLENIUM                     |     3|0    |KxazZfcj|Paulo Caldeira @pjcaldeira|The suggested name is based on the global concerns about climate change since it is a vessel with scientific exploration functions and provides the development of learning activities by young researchers and biologists.

James Clark Ross              |     3|0    |NOYMkh29|Craig Barker-Davis   |James Clark Ross between 1839 and 1843 took 2 voyages to the southern Antarctic and was the first to acknowledge that it was more than just a group of islands, it was a continent. He was the first to call it Antarctica, he discovered the Victoria shelf , which was later named after him, his voyages aboard the HMS Terror and the HMS Erebus were the first to travel as far south as what was possible at the time and he chronicled his journeys and had them published upon his return. He was one who inspired generations after him to explore this vast and beautiful landscape and he realised the importance of this land and its surrounding islands long before others. This is why I think this ship should be named after him to help inspire the next generations to do the same.

The treaty has been described by Kofi Annan as perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date. This achievement by these British scientists demonstrates the importance of polar research in understanding the Earths natural processes and humanity's impact on them. With the world facing a future dominated by concerns of Climate Change, it would be great if the scientists and researchers working on this ship could take inspiration from the names of three scientists who's discovery actually resulted in global agreement for positive change.

His enthusiasm, infectious curiosity, and manner have been an inspiration whether as a bona-fide naturalist or as a interested citizen. Sullivan: At the end of the International Geophysical Year (1957-8) journalist Walter Sullivan wrote a piece whereby he summed up the absurdity of nations laying claims to Antarctic territory. To quote 'There are postmasters with no mail...magistrates with no cases to try...brass plaques...where men have visited but once...To those who have seen the vastness of the Antarctic ice sheet, the stark splendour...incredible fury of its winds, these displays of national rivalry...seem strangely absurd.' These words perfectly sum up not only the nonsensical idea of laying 'claim', but also how ridiculous national rivalry is today given the numerous environmental threats we face.

He showed determination and fortitude on various tasks. He modified the small ships boat James Caird and undertook the epic voyage of hundreds of miles in the Southern Ocean with Shackelton to fetch help for the rest of the crew . After the expedition he returned to the Merchant Navy but his health had been affected by the conditions he had endured in the James Caird and undertaking lifesaving tasks for the crew of the Endurance. He died in 1930 and was buried in Karori Cemetary Wellington 26.09.1930 with full naval honours from provided by HMS Dunedin. In 1958 the British Antartic Survey named a small island in his honour. His grave was untended: however in 2004 it was tided and a life size statue of his beloved cat Mrs Chippy was placed on his grave by NZAC. A worthy name for the new ship.

Here's a few of the hundreds of reasons I think NERC should choose this name for the ship. Mr Brunel designed the first steam ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, designed the first all metal ship able to cross an ocean, designed a ships propeller that is only 5% less efficient than a modern propeller that's be designed be a computer using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). Mr Brunel designed the Great Eastern, a ship which when she gashed open her hull along 85ft, the passengers never noticed. A smaller rip sank the Titanic which was a far bigger ship.

Each of the three, the James Caird, the Dudley Docker and the Stancomb-Wills, was named after one of the expedition's financial backers . The James Caird is the boat which got the glory of course, and it is still extant displayed at Dulwich College. The Dudley Docker and the Stancomb-Wills have been lost to tide and storm. Dame Janet Stancomb-Wills was a remarkable, and formidable character for her time, and considered worth enough for the Stancomb-Wills Glacier and the Stancomb-Wills Promontory to be named after her. I think mainly though of the sturdy boat which endured beyond the Endurance bearing supplies, and which provided a shelter through the long months on Elephant Island.

Alan M. Turing                |     3|0    |YrlAfrNH|Andrew Connell       |Alan Turing, who was only recently granted a posthumous apology by the British government, revolutionised our world. His work at Bletchley Park cut the length of the war, and led to the development of the digital computer. He explored and discovered what others would dismiss out of hand. Yet, he endured, he prevailed, and consequently so did this nation. What better way to demonstrate our commitment to science and exploration for the coming decades than to name our research vessel after Turing himself?

Known for 'shaping the hills and valleys' (Similar to what the ship will be doing with the ice) Mythological beings always seem to be a good place to look for interesting names, Odin, Thor etc. the idea was to look for a Ice god or goddess to present the ship as the overseer or ruler of the Ice due to the tasks and work it will be doing, finding one that relates to British mythology was an added bonus. In Scotland, where she is also known as Beira, Queen of Winter, she is credited with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket. In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and is said to be the mother of all the gods. Briggs, K. M.

William Dampier               |     3|1    |4dOa65yJ|Lorraine Hawkins     |Dampier influenced several figures better known than he: He made important contributions to navigation, collecting for the first time data on currents, winds and tides across all the world&rsquo;s oceans that was used by James Cook and Horatio Nelson. Daniel Defoe, author of Robinson Crusoe, was likely inspired by accounts of real-life castaway Alexander Selkirk, a crew member on Dampier's voyages. Jonathan Swift explicitly mentions Dampier in his Gulliver's Travels as a mariner comparable to Lemuel Gulliver. His notes on the fauna and flora of north-western Australia were studied by naturalist and scientist Joseph Banks, who made further studies during the first voyage with James Cook. He is cited over 80 times in the Oxford English Dictionary, notably on words such as 'barbecue', 'avocado', 'chopsticks' and 'sub-species'. His observations and analysis of natural history helped Charles Darwin develop his scientific theories. (Much more can be found in Wikipedia.)

A win-win for both parties.

Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker      |     3|1,2,4|HFinClVa|Maggie Robertson @MagpieR793|NERC ships exist to do science, and at least some should be named for scientists rather than explorers. Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker (1901-1957) was a British marine biologist whose research on Porphyria, published in Nature in 1949 (http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v164\/n4174\/abs\/164748a0.html ), led to a revolution in the Japanese nori culture industry, and saved many people from malnutrition and hunger (see http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b04g7rd5 ). Both polar regions, and Antarctica in particular, are often celebrated as landscapes of masculine adventure, yet there are now many women in polar science, some of them very eminent. It is timely to celebrate women in science, and the contribution of science to humanity, by naming one of NERC's ships after KM Drew.
Robert F Scott                |     3|0    |oc2YibxQ|Phillip Matthews     |Robert Falcon Scott was an officer in the Royal Navy. He led two expeditions to the Antarctic, the idea was to explore the part of Antarctica around the Ross Sea, discovered in 1841 by Sir James Clark Ross. Scott also wanted to find out more about the animals, weather and geology of the Antarctic. He and his companions lost their lives on the final return journey. Scott was criticised for the failures but new research has identified that the team would almost certainly have survived if his base camp team had followed the written orders he had left for them.

David Frederick Attenborough  |     3|1    |qbJSloaw|Betheney Wills       |Unlike the other names put forward, Sir David Attenborough is not neccassarily a polar explorer. That being said he is the reason so many young people, like myself take a keen interest in science and caring about protecting our precious planet. This research ship will undoubtably be paid for in part by tax-payers money. Who do they relate to when it comes to Natural Sciences and environmental protection? Sir David Attenborough. We all love to be whisked away by his programs on the BBC, he is still working hard into his 80's, producing captivating, mesmerizing work. If this ship is named after him, we can thank him for his unwavering dedication to documenting the changes of our planet and the wildlife we share it with. His legacy will live on and keep inspiring future generations to help protect our planet.
Apsley Cherry-Gerard          |     3|1,2  |dMpVHZUM|Meric Srokosz        |Apsley Cherry-Gerard as an English Antarctic explorer who was member of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition (1910-1913) and is known for his historical account of this expedition 'The Worst Journey in the World' (1922). With two others he crossed the Ross Ice Shelf in appalling conditions and returned with Emperor Penguin eggs for scientific study, which was the aim of the journey. He succeeded in his part of the expedition, in contrast to Scott who failed in his (and sadly died). So despite difficult circumstances he achieved the science aims. Therefore it seems appropriate to name a scientific vessel that will operate in difficult circumstance after him.

Although just one of many well-known exploits, his time at Halley was marked by a substantial improvement in quality of life for all around and a dramatic increase in the prowess of the British Antarctic Survey in that year. Indeed, while departure of such a character to the Halley community was indeed devestating, his legacy is everywhere to be seen. We here at Halley strongly feel that the Mike Neaverson would be the only fitting name for such a vessel that, we can but hope, will live up to his accomplishments.

The Conqueror should do just that to the names that demote its importance and presence.

Hunky Dory                    |     2|0    |CmvDxvd1|Thomas Sullivan @ThomSul|Name this ship the RRS Hunky Dory, as a tribute to David Bowie. This boat is both 'hunky' and a 'dory', thus there can be no name more fitting. David Bowie was an ever changing explorer, a constant innovator, a bold discoverer, a pusher of boundaries, and a bloody genius. He once said in a 1983 interview, 'I mean, my whole life is made up of experimentation, curiosity, and anything that seemed at all appealing.' If only this was a spaceship, then it could be named 'Blackstar', 'Ziggy Stardust', or 'Space Oddity'. Although some say the stardom all began with the 'Hunky Dory'. Speaking of which, do you know of any spaceship naming contests coming up?

Its presence in polar exploration sometimes thwarting polar explorers (Croker Land) and subtly highlights the risk explorers and researchers sometimes take in discovering the truth behind the 'mystery' of nature.

Ascension                     |     2|0    |1xyGsPS0|Dave Allen           |In 1836 the Beagle, with Charles Darwin aboard, visited Ascension Island. He noted the shortage of potable water. A number of years later the botanist explorer, Joseph Hooker visited. He came up with a plan to modify the climate of a part of Ascension Island by planting trees on Green mountain. The planted trees would make for improved soils and the trees would capture more water. For years after trees and plants from around the world were taken to Ascension and planted. A tropical cloud forest on the peak of green mountain. The climate of Ascension Island improved and there has been an increase in potable water. This positive result was due to exploration, planning and investing in the future of man. I feel that naming the ship 'RRS Ascension' may teach and remind those who sail on her, and others, of the importance of research, exploration and planning.

See the following web sites for more information: ( http:\/\/www.historymuseum.ca\/cmc\/exhibitions\/hist\/cae\/peo60e.shtml ) & http:\/\/www.historymuseum.ca\/cmc\/exhibitions\/hist\/cae\/peo614e.shtml#natkusiak I first read about him while visiting the Canadian Museum of Nature. Having been a sailor, explorer and hunter in the North, I thought it would be fitting to choose an Eskimo name to mark the nature of the new ship's mission. The name, having four syllables, flows quite nicely after RSS, is easily remembered and lends itself to a friendly term of endearment to those who will call it home. (RSS Nat). Natsukiak is said to have been one of the best Eskimo hunters around - fitting for a research vessel & Harold Noice found him 'jolly, fond of telling funny stories and a bundle of energy' - which is also fitting for a research vessel.

Alison Hargreaves             |     2|0    |3F7SjEng|Strachan McCormick   |A great British adventurer, Alison Hargreaves died on K2 in 1995 whilst in pursuit of an extraordinary first. Having already been the first person (male or female) to solo climb all of the great north faces of the alps in a single season, and the second to solo Mount Everest, unsupported and without supplementary oxygen (after only Reinhold Messner, generally considered the greatest ever mountaineer), she was aiming to climb all of the world's three highest peaks in a single season. Although Hargreaves' loss meant that her goal was not reached, she was undoubtedly a brilliant mountaineer, operating in some of the harshest terrestrial environments. For this reason, RRS Alison Hargreaves is a fitting name for a ship that will emulate some of that spirit of adventure.

A modest man, apparently upon returning home to Wales he avoided the welcoming home party waiting for him at the local railway station by going across the tracks and out the other side of the station. Blackbarow must have worked hard to live down his stowaway status as Shackelton's afforded him the honour of being the first person to set foot on Elephant Island, although he had to crawl due to the frostbite affecting his feet. I just thought it would be nice for the ship to be named after him rather than those in prominent, priveliged, or TV celebrity status positions.

She was described as a 'wonderfully fine ice ship' by Scott, and performed her duties well for the ill-fated voyage. Her career afterwards was less stellar, ultimately ending in her loss in 1943. The new name would give new life and homage to the previous vessel and her name, and honor the work done by the former.

In the Spring of 1940, allied troops were trapped between the German advance and the sea at Dunkirk in northern France. The evacuation of those troops, 'Operation Dynamo', was helped by private boats which crossed the Channel and, whilst under constant attack from the Luftwaffe, ferried men from the shallow beaches to larger ships offshore. Douglas Tough assembled 100 of these 'Little Ships' at Tough Brothers' boatyard which once stood opposite this plaque. During the 10-day operation they helped in\/ the rescue of 338,226 British and French troops who were saved to fight another day.

Tookoolito was an Inuk woman who was a translator and guide for Arctic explorers in the 1860s and 1870s. There's a more troublesome side of her story too: Tookoolito and her husband Ebierbing were displayed to the public in the UK and US and were referred to as 'Hannah' and 'Joe'. Their relationship with Charles Francis Hall, who brought them to the US seems to have been a respectful one though, and they appeared alongside him in lectures on his Arctic explorations.

It will also help us better understand how global warming affect the oceans and earth climate. New scientific discoveries, new evidences and better understanding of our fragile earth will help us find pressing solutions to save our beloved earth and bring 'deliverance' to our children and for the future generation who call our little blue planet home. Hence, this name, 'DELIVERANCE' is very apt for this new ship. I hereby humbly submit this name 'RRS DELIVERANCE' as my choice for this ship. Thank you.

The words UNITED KINGDOM is something of an influence for this suggestion but removing the word KINGDOM is of no disrespect rather it is to suggest a progression for humanity as a race. Being UNITED will truley set the human race free from this tangible life so that we can answer a higher calling and use our capabilities for good. The ship couldn't have been built without the humans that where working on it being UNITED to achieve that objective regardless of their race, culture or faith, therefore have the word UNITED would make a great statement to the world.

Margaret Irene Monk           |     2|1    |NSeUCMc3|Alasdair Monk        |Born in Prescott in 1941 Margaret Irene Monk was the occupational health nurse who worked at Birkenhead Docks 20 years ago. She heroically rescued a crane operator at the docks who'd had a heart attack whilst operating a crane. With complete disregard for her own safety she scaled the crane and brought the crane operator safely down whilst others hesitated in fear. She recently and suddenly passed away aged 74 having spent a life working as a nurse dedicated to caring for others and working three jobs simultaneously to support her family. Her relentless and tireless dedication to others is emblematic of the spirit of the arctic exploration ship, tirelessly forging ahead despite the challenges to better the lives others.

Nora was a dear friend of mine, much like a Grandma to me. She sadly passed away 3 weeks ago and would have been 85 years young on the 11th April. In life Nora had worked for the Transport and General Workers Union supporting the rights of the workers of key industries, including ship building. Despite sailing through some rough seas in life (losing her husband and her only son) Nora remained strong to the end and refused to sink under the waves. She was a true adventurer, never letting her age hold her back. Every year she'd take herself away on holiday - even at the age of 83, her favourite place was Ibiza. Those who knew Nora well joke that she must have secretly loved the cold, as despite numerous arguments, she'd never let us arrange her having central heating fitted in her house. Nora was an inspiration to me, it'd be great if her name could inspire others now.

And it has to have its original NPRV title, because as any sea lover knows. This bad luck to change the name of a ship. My dad was a merchant seaman, so, that's why I am having a go at naming the ship. I hope it's one of many many more to birth from Cammell Lairds shipyard. Thanks Eileen

If the vessel is named RRS SEPTENTRIO, the ship's crest could include Ursa Major; and seven is a lucky number. Thus tradition, gravitas and a ship's crest all in one.

Something which always makes me smile, is that across the whole book is that the incredible optimism and good morale through unimaginable torment displayed by the crew which I always perceive as only ever slightly faltering at ONE point. when the Bovril ran out. Now this may sound like a joke entry, but its not, throughout that amazing expedition they had to sacrifice so much, they were isolated from the rest of the world, they didn't even realise the massive scale of the first world war happening whilst they were stuck, the Bovril cubes were the last of there initial reserves to run out, the last food from home. They were sliced wafer thin, a cube lasted them three days. In the book when it finally runs out you can tell its the moment when they realise the severity of the situation. Bovril cube is a fine name for a ship, as long as you've got a Bovril cube left, you know your in a good place.

A science vessel would do well to be named for those that potential inspired some of it's crew to become scientists. It says that the ship is heading out to bust myths about the polar region and discover the facts, the science. As an additional bonus the name has the verb 'bust' in it, which evokes a proactive stance, and in context the image of 'busting' through polar ice to get the science done.

On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82&deg;S and discovered the Polar Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. During the second adventure, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, on their return journey, Scott's party discovered plant fossils, proving Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents. A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, and at a distance of 150 miles from their base camp and 11 miles from the next depot, Scott and his companions died from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold.

George Martin                 |     2|0    |1dgwOSju|Rob McKay @SherringtonRobM|The late Sir George Martin CBE was the world famous musical producer behind the Beatles. Having passed away this month, he leaves a legacy of musical adventure including 30 number one hit singles in the UK and 23 in the US across many genres. His pioneering approach to music bears great resemblance to the pioneering nature of this vessel and its purpose. His enthusiasm for venturing into so many different musical genres seems fitting with a vessel which will venture into some of the most challenging environments on the planet. The Beatles music was revolutionary at the time and touched people all over the world taking bold risks to charter new territory. Likewise this ship will need to do the same. The fact it is being built in Merseyside seems like the icon on the cake.
Frederic John Walker          |     2|0    |Lg1GWlZI|John Martin          |Capt `Johnnie' Walker was the commander of HMS Starling during WW2. He was the most successful commander in WW2 in terms of U Boat kills. He was based in Liverpool where the Western Command headquarters was situated. Sadly he died as a result of a cerebral haemorrhage, believed brought on by overwork. He will have known the Cammell Laird ship yard very well. I don't profess to know everything about this man. All I know about him is what I have read in history books and on the internet. I'm 57 so of course I would never have met him. I have no link to him or his family. But if ever there was a true leader, a man willing to take an unorthodox approach, a man willing to explore other methods, it was him. Therefore, an appropriate name for a ship ahead of its' time. He was buried at sea in Liverpool Bay. Wouldn't it be marvellous for RSS Frederic John Walker, to sail out of Cammell Laird's and out to the place of his burial to commemorate his life and give a nations' thanks?

HYDRURGA                      |     2|1    |0ejrAByg|Anthony Crook @AtCrooky|Taken from the binomial name for the Leopard Seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) which rules the southern ocean as one of the apex predators of the antarctic ecosystem; the new research vessel will hopefully reflect this status and be a leading light in antarctic science. Hydrurga means 'water-worker', which exemplifies exactly what the new BAS vessel will be doing to the highest level. The bow of the new research vessel also resembles the shape of the leopard seals' long serpentine mouth and snout. It would also be a nice way to remember Kirsty Brown a BAS employee who's life was tragically taken by a leopard seal in 2003 at the Rothera research station, the name would thus serve as a reminder to us all to respect these magnificent creatures and their environment.

His polar expedition of 101 years ago still stands tall as one of the greatest feats of leadership in adversity ever known. When his ship, the Endurance broke up and sank in Antarctica, Ernest Shackleton lead all his men over hundreds of miles and months by foot, and boat to safety. Truly the greatest of Polar stories. He deserves to have a ship named after him and anyone who travels on her should be honoured to do so in his memory.

The Nereids are the fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris, who make their homes in the seas. Nereus was also know as the Old Man of the Seas.

Thus far, none have been named after a woman. Gertrude Bell was an explorer, archaeologist and diplomat, who explored and mapped important parts of Mesopotamia in the early 20th Century. An influential diplomat among Arab leaders, her knowledge and connections were invaluable to Britain during WW1. At a time when Britain is rightly re-examining the legacies of its colonial past, it would be fitting to name a ship after one of the few explorers which local populations held in respect and affection.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86&deg;13.6&prime;N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Aptenodytes                   |     2|1    |t7hWBasT|Eleanor Pollitt      |Latinate names are both the most common and the most apt for ship names besides the names of real people, and so Latin forms the basis for this submission. 'Aptenodytes' means 'featherless diver', which would on the surface seem to fit only one of the descriptors for a seagoing vessel that isn't a submarine. However, this name will embody the power from both air and sea this ship holds, and do so via apt contradiction. A polar ship fitted with robotic submarines shall be fitted well by a name of diver- a polar ship fitted with a helipad will be served with a healthy dose of irony by a ship named after 'Aptenodytes Forsteri', the flightless (like helicopters, featherless) emperor penguin. Choose Aptenodytes as the name for a ship breaking new boundaries in the polar region, and you will have a name that will compliment by contradiction, will roll fittingly off the tongue (can you say 'ursus maritimus three times fast?), and would be (probably) the first penguin to ever reach the Arctic.

Otto Sverdrup                 |     2|1    |VpcRQV2U|Michael Jones        |Otto Sverdrup was the principal explorer and cartographer of the Canadian High Arctic, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Though not British, his efforts helped open and understand this huge polar region, after the earlier important (and sometimes tragic) explorations of famous British explorers. The new NERC vessel will itself, with its compliments of scientists, explore ever more broadly and deeply than ever before. Importantly, NERC's international collaborations will continue a long line of peaceful research, just as the Norwegian Sverdrup did so long ago. One of the places Sverdrup mapped was Alexandra Fiord on Ellesmere Island, where I conducted my doctoral studies on climate change. Canadian, US, British, Russian, Danish, and others have worked there together. Congratulations and best wishes! Michael Hunt Jones, PhD (retired)

E\u00e4rendil                 |     2|0,2  |tYSBfzum|Andrew  Meijers      |E&auml;rendil the Mariner is a fictional character from a 1914 poem by JRR Tolkins entitled 'The Voyage of E&auml;rendel the Evening Star'; which later found its way into his Middle Earth legendarium. The character was a great mariner who's name translates to 'Lover of the Sea'. This character was an ocean explorer before performing selfless acts of valour and eventually being rewarded by becoming the evening star (Venus). Although a fiction, the name does stem from old English and thus is fitting for a British ship, while also fitting in with the astronomical theme of other nation's Southern Ocean research vessels (more imaginative than the Aurora Australis and better sounding than Polarstern). While the science link is a little tenuous, aside from being an ocean explorer, such a name does carry solid geek cachet (we scientists were nerdy before it was cool) and a correctly used diacritic umlaut in a name is just plain metal.

In 1999, she also completed an expedition to the south pole, during which time meteorological data was gathered. In 2003-4 she skied solo and without re-supply to the south pole. It took her 43 days, 23 hours to complete. Despite this being a race she still collected meteorological and physiological data along the way. In 2007, she attempted to become the first woman to trek solo to the north pole. She had to abandon the trek just short due the fragility of the ice. In March 2016, she will attempt her last solo expedition to the north pole. If she succeeds, she will be the first woman to reach both the north and south poles She is represents bravery, science, true polar expeditions and female scientists!

Mirovia                       |     1|1    |0vJQlxt9|Rowan McKibbin       |Mirovia was a superocean which may have surrounded the supercontinent Rodinia (also known as Pangaea), 750 million to 1 billion years ago. It comes from the Russian word 'mirovoy' meaning global. I think the name is appropriate as it not only has the obvious ocean connection but also has the global meaning. It also sounds classical and is easy to pronounce and spell. It gives a sense of timelessness and rooting in the ancient history of the earth.

He obviously influenced later Antarctic exploration through this Arctic expeditions, in particular planning for deliberate wintering over and the fact that people with him subsequently participated in Antarctic Exploration, most significantly of course James Clark Ross. It is noted that he had a magnificent career as a Royal Navy Officer and that he also features in Canadian and Australian history. Noting too that BAS now has responsibilities for both Arctic and Antarctic Science, and while previous B.A.S. ships have been named after Antarctic people I suggest it is now most appropriate that an Arctic explorer be so honoured, and consequently be brought to prominence with the International Polar community.

JOHN  HARRISON                |     1|1    |kNzGj4eX|James L. Moore       |John Harrison, 1693-1776 , was the inventor of the Marine Chronometer which made it possible to accurately determine Longitude at sea thereby making it the most significant advance in ensuring safety at sea since the Compass. The imaginary lines of Latitude extend Pole to Pole and the voyaging of the new research vessel will also cover North and South Poles. The research and development work undertaken by John Harrison to achieve his goal took a lifetime of dedication to overcome all the obstacles and problems that he faced ( this may well be a reflection of the research still to come using the new ship ) but in the end, through sheer persistence and a belief that these efforts will bring the correct result he finally succeeded. As a recognition of his success he was the winner of the prize money awarded by the Board of Longitude set up by the Longitude Act of 1714. In 1749 he was awarded the Copley Medal by the royal society. I believe his name befits a new research vessel.

He was a keen and successful rower, taking part in the Henley Peace regatta in 1919. Irvine first took part in the boat race in 1922 and a year later was on the winning crew. Part of a 1923 Merton College South Pole expedition to Spitsbergen he set of for Everest in 1924. He and his climbing partner George Mallory were sighted only a few hundred metres from the summit of Everest. Mallory's body was later recovered but Irvine's remains are still hidden on Everest. He is remembered in one of the roads in Prenton off Borough Road marking this event - Everest, Mallory and Irvine.

His interest in the Antarctic led to him narrating and presenting several tv and radio programmes about polar exploration and the British Antarctic Survey. He has probably been more instrumental than anyone in bringing the images, sounds and tales of the exploration of Antarctica to British audiences, at least until Sir David Attenborough produced 'Life in the Freezer'.

Hesperis                      |     1|0    |i2nOgRwZ|Dana Balke           |Hesperis is an artic flower observed in all Artic regions: Eurasia, Alaska (US), Canada, Greenland. It's appearance was noted in the 'Narrative of Voyage to the Polar Sea During 1875-6 by HM Ships Alert and Discovery' and the '2nd Norwegian Arctic Expedition in the 'Fram' 1898-1902.' Sir George Nares, honored for his many scientific contributions, commanded the Arctic Expedition 1875-6. Hesperis is rare in the artic since it requires pollinization. A 'minute, red, dipterous insect' was seen pollinating the flower (just as the NERC ship may be painted red exploring among the 'white flowers' of the polar ice caps to 'pollinate' and continue their existance on Earth). The plant's pods were described as 'terete, but for the strong middle vein which forms a sort of keel', [2nd Nor Art Exp., pg. 78]. Hesperis is a perennial which the dictionary defines as 'enduring for an infinite amount of time'. May the RRS Hesperis keep the Earth's ice-covered stern and bow forever blooming.

However, very few are named after women. Naming your research ship after a prominent women in science, specifically a marine biologist who visited Antartica, may inspire young people of all genders to pursue careers in research and science. Unfortunately Bennett does not feature in your polar history which contains just one woman. You have included the first woman in Antartica, Caroline Mikkelsen after whom Mount Caroline Mikkelsen was named, but as yet nothing has been named after Bennett. While you may wish to focus on the work of UK scientists or well-known UK figures I ask you to celebrate the work of women in science to inspire the next generation. Please don't name another ship after another man. We really do celebrate their achievements enough.

Oceanum Custodem              |     1|0    |nCZ35iiD|Shona Walton         |Latin is a neutral international language, suggesting a universal enterprise, but these words' meanings resonate through various extant languages. Words such as Terra, Orbis and Mundo relate too specifically to land-masses, and carry interpretations of Imperial or colonial intent. Maris is simply less ambitious then Oceanus. It is an ocean research vessel, dedicated to understanding and protecting the planet's and humankind's most essential resource. Words such as steward \/ guardian \/ procurator suggest ownership, and their Latin equivalents (vilicus, dispensator, promus) have no modern resonance, whereas 'custodian' suggests stewardship for future generations. English equivalents such as 'Ocean Steward' or 'Sea Guardian' carry echoes of other high profile vessels with a particular political history. (eg Sea Shepherd, Rainbow Warrior) Importantly - I have been twice to Antarctica and 5 times to the Arctic - grand, intimidating, essential. The daft names are demeaning.

Soul Frost                    |     1|0    |q3T54jrs|Isaac Hwang          |The names comes from Advection Frost aka Wind Frost. And according to wikipedia Advection Frost 'refers to tiny ice spikes that form when there is a very cold wind blowing over branches of trees, poles and other surfaces. It looks like rimming on the edge of flowers and leaves and usually it forms against the direction of the wind. It can occur at any hour, day or night.' Those who have explored the North Pole and survived know that their lives will never be the same. When the cold polar wind blows it leaves an imprint upon the souls of those who have ventured into the North Pole. I believe that indelible mark can be expressed as Soul Frost. The new Royal Research Vessel will be carrying many generations of researchers and sailors into the North Pole and so it will be fitting to name it as Soul Frost.

Fortunately they all survived WW2, although they all developed lung conditions due to the harsh working and sleeping environments on board these vessels. He boarded a sinking ship to attach a towing cable once (always said he should not have done this!) and was a member of a crew that insisted on breaking formation to come to the aid of the remaining crew of a torpedoed vessel; that had been adrift for days in the north Atlantic and were in a sorry state (wet and oil soaked). They were cleaned up and given clothing by the crew. (Can provide further information if required). He wished to name Roxanne in memory of the vessel this but my mother insisted I be called Janet.

Sir Leopold McClintock        |     1|1    |vpKspiSP|Mike McClintock      |Sir Leopold was one of the foremost Arctic explorers and is generally credited with confirming the fate of Sir John Franklin. In his day he was the most successful arctic explorer - shown by the fact that none of his officers or crew died on his voyages from starvation or unnatural causes. On 29 October 2009 a special service of thanksgiving was held in the chapel at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, to accompany the rededication of the national monument to Sir John Franklin there. It also marked the 150th anniversary of Sir Francis Leopold McClintock's voyage aboard the yacht Fox.

His work, along with that of fellow Briton Fred Vine and Canadian Lawrence Morley, showed how variations in the magnetic properties of rocks forming the ocean floor could be consistent with, and ultimately help confirm, Harry Hammond Hess's 1962 theory of seafloor spreading. In 1989 he was awarded the Geological Society of London's highest honour, the Wollaston Medal. I worked with Drum for a number of years on cruses on Shackleton, Discovery, John Murry and Jane.

If it wasn't for risk there would be nothing discovered, nothing to conquer and nothing to work towards. Risk is what keeps us moving forward.

LEONID SHARGORODSKYI          |     1|0    |U8XEvPVC|Mikhailo Shargorodskyi @meyshanya|Hi guys! Leonid Shargorodskyi is my uncle. He was a scientist, ethnographer and he discovered the ethnicity of the peoples of the Far North of USSR, their culture, traditions, ceremony. He made four tries to enter the historical faculty in USSR, faced with a lot of problems based on that he was a jew. He worked in small villages and taught children English, worked on the shipbuilding plant, generally did everything that Soviet system forced him to do to pass an exams. Finally he graduated with honors Omsk University and stayed work there after studying. On May of 1992 he had an another expedition to the north. One day when his group rafted on a river their boat has turned over. There were only one man who alive from all group. Leonid drowned. He always was afraid of water and swam very badly. I think that the ship, that bravely swims across cold polar water and keeps the science as the main aim of his life can be the symbol of my uncle. Because we live until others remember us.

She is often attributed to being the protagonist of the tongue-twister &ldquo;She sells sea-shells on the sea-shore&rdquo;. Anning worked to further advance science and research. This naming would be a change in direction of the present fleet names, being that of a scientist and not a polar explorer. This naming therefore would be more reflective of the present day work and research currently being carried out on board these vessels. Additionally this would bring some gender parity to the vessels names, three in the fleet currently being named after men. Recognize someone whom may not have received recognition at the time of their work and continued on despite this lack of recognition, similar to many member of the scientific community today, some of whom may find them-selves working aboard this vessel.

Britain has pioneered science in Antartica for many years. It continues to do so. This ship will not only support the world class science that happens there and the many people that make great personal sacrifices to help advance this scientific work, but it will be beacon to all other Nations that Britain shines in the area like a Polar Star.

Naming the boat thus would celebrate a pioneer of climate research, about which the research ship will be seeking to further increase our knowledge. The fact that Arrhenius was not British also celebrates the importance of international collaboration to combat climate change, and a recognition of the international importance of the polar regions.

Trigger's Broom               |     1|0    |jw9PzVLt|Richard Smith @RSmithFRO|This name comes from the legendary, Only Fools and Horses. It is one of the greatest British accomplishments and is highly regarded across the country as being one of the best cultural outputs since Mr Kipling. It's also named after of course, Trigger's Broom. Trigger won an award for having owned the same broom for 20 years. He later reveals that it has had 17 new heads and 14 new handles, but insists it is still the same broom. This is a metaphor for this vessel. Although it may be new, what it embodies and represents is a proud continuation of the spirit, dedication and persistence that has helped a long line of predecessors drive humanity forward - just like Trigger's Broom.

HW                            |     1|0    |xJvqKQsu|Tony Buckley         |The name comes from the initials of Major Harold William 'Bill' Tilman (CBE, DSO, MC and Bar). Bill Tilman was born in Wallasea, close to where this ship is being built. He was both a noted mountaineer and explorer and a keen sailor who voyaged to both Arctic and Antarctic regions in his boat 'Mischief'. He pioneered ecologically sound principles of exploration and adventure, achieved a great deal with not a lot and documented his achievements in books which are still an inspirational read; the parallels with what is asked of the researchers who will use this ship are marked. Tilman was a modest man, so naming this ship directly after him would not be in keeping with his character. Better then just to use his initials, HW. Tilman placed adverts in The Times for crew for his voyages; 'Hands wanted for long voyage in small boat: no pay, no prospects, not much pleasure'. I'm sure that dry humour will resonate with many who sail on this new vessell.

BLUE LAMBERT                  |     1|1,4  |vjWpg4nd|Dan Clayton          |The world's largest glacier is Lambert Glacier, located in Antarctica, measuring approximately 100km wide, 400km long and 2.5km deep! Because glacial ice is so dense and compact, it often appears a bright blue! Earth's two ice sheets cover most of Greenland and Antarctica and make up more than 99% of the world&rsquo;s glacial ice. If the Antarctic ice sheet were to melt entirely, it is estimated that sea levels would rise by around 65m. That means that London would be lost underwater!Glacial ice can be hundreds of thousands of years old, which makes it a valuable resource for assessing climate change. By extracting and analysing the ice, scientists can learn about what the climate was like on Earth thousands of years ago!

Besides, the name is fun! But at the same time serious and appropriate.
Guyer Rock                    |     1|1    |KWNu5YZy|Robert Ainsworth     |My cousin, Lt Col Simon Guyer (Royal Marines) unfortunately lost his battle with lung cancer exactly one year today. In 1985-86, Simon was a member of the Royal Marine detachment accompanying the British Antarctic Expedition aboard HMS Endurance which, whilst he was Officer of the Watch, grounded on an uncharted rock 30 kms west of Flyspot Rocks, Marguerite Bay, off the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. In 1986, the UK Antarctica Place-Names Committee named the rock 'Guyer Rock' after Simon. I propose that the new polar research vessel, currently being built in the North West, be named RRS Guyer Rock in memory of Simon who: 1) was born and brought up in North West, 2) accompanied the British Antarctic Expedition aboard HMS Endurance during his lifelong service with the Royal Marines, and 3) discovered a previously unknown part of Antarctica - perhaps one day, RRS Guyer Rock could again visit Guyer Rock (but not as close!) and remember Simon's visit some 30 odd years before.

TIDEWATER                     |     1|1    |1ucRhuZ2|Paul morris          |As the name implies, these are valley glaciers that flow far enough to reach out into the sea. Tidewater glaciers are responsible for calving numerous small icebergs, which although not as imposing as Antarctic icebergs, can still pose problems for shipping lanes.

Argonaut                      |     1|0    |ZxaGEJhs|Zahrah Chowdhury     |I think this name will be a perfect name for the ship as this ship will be going on dangerous but very rewarding missions. The meaning of Argonaut is 'someone potentially going on a dangerous but rewarding adventure'. The meaning of the name is found in Greek mythology whereby one of the heroes sailed with Jason in search of the Golden Fleece. This Golden Fleece was owned by a King and guarded in a sacred grove by a dragon and was retrieved by the brave Jason and the Argonauts. Therefore the name relates well as the ship will be sailing across a dangerous and adventurous climate. Returning with new analysis of Antarctica and artic ocean and the impact of climate changes that will potentially affect our planet. The end result will indeed be immensely rewarding for our scientists.

Crean&rsquo;s story is a testament of human fortitude against all the elements of Antarctic, his 36 mile, solitary trek to base camp during the Terra Nova expedition to rescue his comrades Teddy Evans and William Lashly has been described by Antarctic historians as &ldquo;the finest feat of individual heroism from the entire age of exploration&rdquo;.As far as I know he is the only polar explorer to have a song written about him 'The ballad of Tom Crean' We hear a lot about the Scott and Shackleton but Crean and his fellow sailors where the backbone of an expedition just like the men and women who will man your ship.

Sadly Henry Worsley's attempt ended just 36 odd miles short of his pick up point. He died of complete organ failure in Punta Arenas on 26 Jan 2016. Worsley was attempting to raise donations for the Endeavour Fund (Part of the Princes Foundation Trust) for wounded servicemen and women who wish to undertake activities in the physical arena as part of their rehabilitation . Henry Worsley was aiming to raise &pound;100,000 by his trek however I believe that over &pound;400,000 has been raised to date in memory of Henry Worsley and his attempt. I can think of no worthier name than The Worsley Endeavour for the ship in honour of a truly inspirational man whose thoughts always was for those less fortunate than himself. His own personal hero and idol was no less a man than Ernest Shackleton.

He made important contributions to navigation, collecting for the first time data on currents, winds and tides across all the world&rsquo;s oceans that was used by James Cook and Horatio Nelson. His observations and analysis of natural history helped Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin develop their scientific theories. I am not sure if there ever has been a ship named in his honour. If not maybe it's time.

Windsor                       |     1|0    |lGcMa0Oq|Luke Brandon @BrandonUK96|Many British citizens have supported the UK's endeavours at the poles and none more so than the royal family. The royal family's patronage of many scientific, environmental and wildlife causes as well as HRH Prince Harry's 'walking with the wounded' expedition to the North Pole exemplify Britain's role in polar research. In honour of the role of many members of the royal family the new RRS should be named Windsor, a name that has over the years come to be synonymous with perseverance, hope, integrity and inspiration. These qualities are shared by the UK's scientific undertakings in the polar regions and for a research vessel to bear the name Windsor is not simply an honour in itself but it will be a name that symbolizes the ship and her crews' qualities and very mission statement throughout her service. Windsor is a name that emanates inspiration and respect. It is a name worthy of a of Britain's new research vessel.

Neutrino                      |     1|0    |9RGRkzXc|Ricardo Randall @RicardoRandall|Neutrinos are highly interesting subatomic particles. They are generated naturally by the sun and supernovae and by high energy non-natural processes but interact very weakly with other particles (and themselves) and are therefore difficult to detect. Detectors have been placed in Antarctica and other interesting geographical locations (e.g. deep underground) and these particles therefore represent the continued fusion of exploration and science. Because neutrinos interact weakly with other particles they also make a good probe for three-dimensionally imaging objects far away. This is an analogy of using the ship for scientific exploration, to penetrate oceans and ice sheets. For these reasons, and because the name sounds cool, the ship should be called RSS Neutrino.

POLAR CHALLENGE               |     1|0    |77JYBbhQ|Martin Humphreys     |POLAR--The first part of the name geologically identifies where this ship will be operating. As soon as anyone sees the name they know immediately to which part of the earth it relates to, that its not say a cruise ship to the Caribbean. It embodies BOTH the polar regions, not just the north or just the south pole. CHALLENGE--The second part of the name describes to one and all the challenges which lie ahead of all those who sail in her, and will be involved in any way in the work ahead. The word explains the difficulties and hopes of everyone involved, including the researchers to bring new knowledge into our world. 200 Million Pounds is an indication of how a challenge has been faced and overcome by all those who have been involved in this huge project to build such a wonderful ship. 'RRS. POLAR CHALLENGE' sums up in just two words the spirit and heart of everyone who has been involved in making their dream a reality and those who face the challenges yet to come.

Long Strider                  |     1|0    |XBf84gCC|Michael Richmond @mhr1711|The recurring suggestions for John Rae speak for themselves. I can think of nothing more appropriate than to endow this vessel with the spirit of John Rae. To allow all associated with the ship and it&rsquo;s work to be inspired by the skills, knowledge and achievements or this great explorer would hopefully set them on a course to emulate similar achievements. To break away from the Victorian sensibilities which prevented proper acknowledgement and celebration of John Raes&rsquo; achievements would signal a real commitment to knowledge, truth and understanding. My suggested names include RSS John Rae, RSS John Rae - Long Strider, RSS John Rae \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472 and RSS Long Strider. In the Inuktitut language of Northern Canada, John Rae was known as Long Strider and can be written using Canadian Aboriginal syllabics as the \u140a\u14a1\u14d8\u1472 shown in one of my suggested names.

I'm sure there are many other explorers worthy of memory in the naming of such a distinguished vessel but the thought of the courage of the mariners back in the 14th century as they sailed in vessels so fragile in comparison to modern day craft, for me, deserves the highest recognition and their name on the side of this great ship! Good to all that sail in her, Neil Frame.

Pyrola grandiflora is described as circumpolar (which puts me in mind of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current) and can grow in tundra-like climates, suggestive of both the Arctic and Antarctic. It is also very nearly an anagram of 'polar', but I see that as just a bonus!

Polar Saga                    |     1|0    |JZ5V0UpN|Neil Brown           |The vessel will be operating in both polar regions and this name reflects the fact. In a more inspirational sense a saga is an epic tale of worthy men and women, who may be pagan, christian or other (reflecting diverse backgrounds). The tale weaves a narrative around human beings on a legendary journey (literal or metaphorical) and relates their actions and the dilemmas they face in a manner that one can understand. I believe this vessel will be crewed by people from many various backgrounds working to create a modern day saga of scientific discovery, based on epic journeys and overcoming heroic challenges that may ultimately provide insight to our wider salvation as a race. A true saga.

Although it did confirm the existence of the Northwest Passage, the ship was trapped in ice and abandoned after three years. The name reflects the new ship's ongoing role in investigating the polar regions.
Fidentia                      |     1|0    |de0CfZ0b|Alexander Burgess    |Fidentia can be translated from Latin as 'Boldness' or 'Confidence', these are the characteristics of which should encapsulate any vessel on the forefront of science and adventure.

Also, despite being an awesome name, I don't believe any large vessels on the open seas currently use the name, making it unique!

The Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis (The Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot) dating back to at least 800 AD tell the story of Brendan's (c. 489-583) seven-year voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to a new land and his return. Convinced that the legend was based in historical truth, in 1976 Severin built a replica of Brendan's currach. Handcrafted using traditional tools, the 36-foot (11 m), two masted boat was built of Irish ash and oak, hand-lashed together with nearly two miles (3 km) of leather thong, wrapped with tanned ox hides and sealed with wool grease. Between May 1976 and June 1977, Severin and his crew sailed the Brendan 4,500 miles (7,200 km) from Ireland to Peckford Island, Newfoundland: a true explorer.

Having the meaning 'featherless diver', Aptenodyte forms the first half of 'aptenodytes fosteri', the scientific title for the emperor penguin. Regal, iconic, and the most well-known symbol of the Antarctic, the emperor penguin would form a fitting symbol for the ship as a whole. The robotic submarines to go alongside the Aptenodyte (see how natural that looks?) could be 'penguin subs' or 'penguins' to match. The fact that a ship named for a flightless bird would have a helipad would just be plain amusing. Choose Aptenodyte as the name of the ship, and it will be the first penguin (probably) to reach the Arctic. Plus, if one day it's shored up and obsolete, you could make it a museum and sell penguin-themed stuff in the gift shop. Win-win.

Cameron Bodia                 |     1|0    |AZGsFnbr|Chris Smith          |Dr Cameron Bodia (born October 1880) was a pioneer British nutritionist in the early 20th century. His work on calorific intake was vital in ensuring that polar explorations had sufficient provisions without carrying unnecessary weight. He has been largely forgotten by history and is often uncredited for his work with Roald Amundsen and his team. He received no financial reward for his work and was left destitute after a fire at his Sussex home. After a few months of homelessness, he joined the British army to fight in WWI. He died of Pneumonia in Belgium in February 1915. He left no family behind. I feel that it is unfair that Dr. Bodia has never received any recognition for his work that influenced polar exploration and how that work is still referenced and used in modern explorations. I think this would be a way for the world of exploration to pay their respects for a man that shaped all they do.

Firstly it is derived from the Allt na h-Eirbhe, meaning 'Stream at the boundary wall' which is perhaps apt for an ice breaker. Secondly, it is regarded as the coldest place in the UK. On 30 December 1995, the lowest temperature UK Weather Record was recorded there, at &minus;27.2&deg;C.

Given that the polar vortex also impacts the weather in the arctic I feel it appropriate to recognize this phenomenon.

George Nares                  |     1|1    |Ex267uyn|Thomas Marchant @tom.marchant711|George Nares was an extremely important naval and arctic explorer in the 19th Century. His successful navigation of the straight between Greenland and Ellesmere Island (now named the Nares Straight in his honour) allowed explorers after him to gain far easier and quicker access to the Arctic than before. His navigation of the Suez Canal (the first to do so) and his Challenger expedition, which helped chart and record lots of information in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. His devotion to both Science and the Sea make him the perfect candidate for a research vessel, as this boat embodies the principles of good research and exploration that George Nares lived by, and what he is still remembered for today.

It is thought to refer to the extreme north within the arctic circle and in ancient times explorers would adventure to seek out information on, and hope to discover, Hyperborea; it is these associations with research and exploration, as well the origins of the name as a reference to a polar region, which make the 'RSS Hyperborea' the ideal name in my opinion.

British ships and explorations should reflect the pioneering nature and character that comes with operating in some of the harshest conditions on the planet. Undoubtedly this ship will discover new wildlife, meteorological challenges and anomalies and what better way to name a ship than after a famous British Arctic explorer who is synonymous with this type of research and polar exploration?

Euphausiid                    |     1|1,4  |JhLKR5L1|Bryce Stewart @BD_Stew|Euphausiids or crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea are otherwise known as krill. Krill have a global distribution but are particularly abundant in polar seas where they make up more biomass than any other species. As such they support a vast network of species which feed upon them - everything from small fish to whales. It would be great to reflect this central role they play in polar ecosystems in the name of your new ship. Krill are also increasingly threatened by climate change - naming the ship Euphausiid could help highlight this crucial issue.

It had more personal connections due to it setting sail from Southampton docks (the pier) where I worked for more than 15 years. It has been a very interesting reading the story of that voyage and shows how much technology has changed things.

PEGASUS                       |     1|0    |XCYHulvv|Matthew  Kerr-Sheppard |Pegasus is world known for being a figure of wisdom and determination. Which is what the NERC I believe are trying to achieve with this new ship. To explore where others will not and to go further then others can. The artic and Antarctica are both still some of the only places mankind has an unknown for and with that a sort of fear. This one could say makes them have their own sort of mythological presence about them in today's modern world. A place so hostile, so unforgiving yet has such a massive impact on our world with the likes of climate change and wildlife. PEGASUS will hopefully inspire future generations not of the Greek myth but of the NERC ship that dared to conquer new research through both wisdom and determination.

Many men owed their lives to Wild's leadership and courage.

Adopting his name for the NERC, would not only give him the recognition he so rightly deserves , it would also be a poignant and befitting name for a scientific research vessel designed to overcome he polar elements, especially given that he perished as a direct result of his vessel becoming icebound.

My father's, tales tied with the more scientific account of Scott's forlorn hope , in my opinion, shows that behind every glorious hero, there's a lot of people putting in the leg work and graft.

She spent more than two years in the field with Sir Ranulph and his companions and as a result was the first woman to receive the Polar Medal. She was also the first woman member of the Antarctic Club. She became Britain's most experienced polar radio operator, she set up and maintained 80ft radio masts in the Arctic and Antarctic, often in high winds and temperatures of -50C. In Antarctica in 1980, she was instrumental in saving the lives of a group of South African scientists lost to the north of her isolated base. She was a modest and private person, she hated being in the spotlight, and never took credit for her achievements;how lovely then to acknowledge her unique contribution to polar exploration posthumously.

After Aurora's escape from the ice he brought her safely to New Zealand, but was thereafter replaced as the vessel's commander. He later served with distinction in the Royal Navy during both World Wars. Between 1927 and 1929 he captained the Discovery on oceanographic and whaling research voyages in Southern Atlantic and Antarctic waters. At the outbreak of World War II, however, Stenhouse signed on for active service. Whilst in the Gulf of Aden in 1940, he risked his own life to save that of a crew member after his ship was struck by a mine. On 12 September 1941 he was reported missing, presumed killed, when his ship exploded and sank in the Red Sea.

As the known world grows ever larger, the areas beyond experience become ever more distant and exotic, even when we know it we never know enough. It still takes the heart of the explorer to set on a journey to Arctic or Antartic be it a scientist, artist or even one of us. So far away from the everyday world the ship journey takes time and at the heart of the scientific explorer is both the experience and the discovery. Still much unknown worlds, the imagined ideas are formed on a journey together with scientific data give way to the real, and fantasy to move science still farther away. The ship is a vessel that carries ideas, data, people in quest between the the margins of the Earth, the Antipodes, driven by human desire to know the world, guided by scientific knowledge - a bright everlasting star.

SKYE                          |     0|1    |uBEhvLyl|Matilda Shaw         |I believe that the polar research ship should be called Skye. This is because, huskies are an indigenous animal in the North and South Pole and many Huskies are called Skye because of their shocking blue eyes. In addition to this, most of the journey will be spent on water, and water is obviously blue.As mentioned previously, Huskies eyes are commonly blue and so that would coincide with the hue of the sea. Data can then also be extracted from the sea to suggest reasons for global warming or changes for the wildlife there. Moreover, the skies will be studied on the reconnaissance to suggest why global warming is increasing. Possibly because of atmospherical changes or because of pollution. Hopefully you could take this name into consideration, Yours sincerely, Matilda Shaw

Polar Incisor                 |     0|0    |a1zYgDmH|Safet Krasniqi @SafetKrasniqi|Some of the reasons to name the ship: 1. Sounds great: RRS Polar Incisor 2. Incisor means: TOOTH 3. Tooth is the STRONGEST mineralized structure of the human body. 4. Incisors are the teeth in the FRONT and CENTER of the mouth. NERC seeking to be in the FRONT of the researching projects 5. Incisors are usually the FIRST teeth to erupt - explains the LEADING advances NERC has achieved with the state of the art technology. 6. Incisors are adapted to CUTTING, TEAR APART, PENETRATE and\/or GNAW food and other materials. This analogy is used to explain the ability of the polar ship to cut, penetrate and break the ice. Thank You! SK.

But she is an amazing person, she is a strong independent woman that represents warmth, love and caring. She is stable like a rock, giving her time and attention to those around her. Her love for the north is boundless, she longs to see northern lights and when she does her happyness reaches its all time high spreading smiles to those around her. This love for the north is complemented with her love for wildlife, especially with northern animals. She is a woman of the north in heart resides in the shining lights of a dark northern sky. Her heart belongs in the north. and it is for these reasons I believe naming this ship after her is not only recogizing the respect, wonder and love she has for north and its exploration. The name is also representing her strength, love and care for people which carries a strong value with a crew embarking on exploration.

According to the Prose Edda, Odin took Loki's three children by Angrbo&eth;a--the wolf Fenrir, Hel, and J&ouml;rmungandr--and tossed J&ouml;rmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard.The serpent grew so large that he was able to surround the earth and grasp his own tail. As a result, he received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. When he lets go, the world will end. J&ouml;rmungandr's arch-enemy is the god Thor. It is an example of an ouroboros.

Drake most certainly discovered the infamous Drakes Channel between The Antarctic and the coast of South America, thus allowing passage between the Atlantic and the Paciffic Oceans. This voyage was a mavelous act of seamanship a true voyage of discovery. Although there have been many polar explorers, who could truely match this fantastic voyage by an amazing man.

Marchesi                      |     0|0    |HqDKmVwH|Tim Whitcombe        |I'd like to think the new ships name represents British polar efforts SINCE 1945 rather than historical names from previous centuries which has always been the case. A new departure is needed to reflect the modern reality of polar science both north and south which this ship will be involved in. I'd also like the new name to make a clear departure from the heroic age of British polar effort on mainly the other side of the continent. The name should pay tribute to British effort since 1945. I know you probably have Sir Vivian Fuchs in mind but apart from the name sounding unfortunate I think we should consider the 'everyman' aspect of science these days and recognise the collective effort of polar science by not naming after a single individual. RRS Penola seems appropriate but it does not have quite the ring and gravitas. About turn as I light upon RRS Halley but someone has got there before me predictably. Oh well back to post 1945 names - how about RRS Marr, RRS H R Mill.

Macroscian                    |     0|1    |LRmjhoep|Rob Webster @websterguitars|'Macroscian' is a great and underused word appropriate to the name of a polar ship: 1. adjective : Casting a long shadow 2. noun : An inhabitant of the Arctic or Antarctic zones It therefore neatly encapsulates the stature of NERC and BAS as scientific titans, and gives reference to those who work and live in the high latitudes. I feel this is more appropriate than ice-related names which have been heavily used in other polar ships, or names of major figures. If a named individual, I think it would be helpful to have a suitable female, though Antarctic history for women has been too short to supply the necessary heroine (naming after a living person would be problematic). Consider also that the name of the ship would be colloquially shortened, in this case probably to 'The Macro' or similar, which I think has a nice ring to it.

The mythical Strait of Anian was part of the legendary Northwest Passage that was thought to link the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The possibility that Anian could provide a shorter and safer water route to the Orient than the treacherous journey around the Cape of Good Hope inspired voyages by many brave seafarers, including Martin Frobisher, Henry Hudson, John Cabot, Corte-Real, Jacques Cartier, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Sir Francis Drake, and Juan de Fuca. Samuel Hearne, on his land voyage from Fort Prince of Wales to the Arctic Ocean and back (completed in 1772), did not encounter the mythical strait. James Cook cast serious doubt on its existence in 1778 on his third Pacific voyage and Captain George Vancouver finally dispelled the myth in his voyage of 1792-94. But the assiduous search for the mythical passage helped to map the vast Arctic coastline.

Eratosthenes                  |     0|0,2,4|43LTmHys|John Hay-Heddle      |Eratosthenes was a Greek Philosopher who lived in 3rd Century BC Alexandria. His principal claim to fame was that he was the first recorded individual to estimate the circumference of the Earth to a high degree of precision. He noted that there was a well on the Nile Island of Elephantine down which the Sun shone vertically on Midsummer solstice day. On the same day he noted that a column at Alexandria cast a shadow at an angle he could measure. Knowing the distance from Alexandria to Elephantine he was able to work out the circumference of the earth to within a few hundred miles - a couple of percent - of what we now know to be its true value.

When at present research data is debated and misrepresented, let the 'Dawn Herald' be an end to that. It also has poise and distinction such that at its very mention all should be steered clearly in its company. On many occasions data from the 'Dawn Herald' will be referenced in critical decision making among politicians where respect and accord will allow us all to move forward given light. This will not only be accomplished in the sound presentation of data, but in the provision of the most agreeable circumstances possible, as 'RRS Dawn Herald' would do.

Oden's Sight                  |     0|0    |AyRKPTa0|Katy Macpherson      |Odin was a Norse God, he had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and wisdom and would pay any price in his quest to gain it. Mimir was a being known to be the most knowledgeable in all the cosmos. Mimir's knowledge was due to the water that was kept in his well. Odin seeked out Mimir and asked for a drink from his well. Mimir wanted to Odin to make a personal sacrifice in his quest for knowledge and asked Odin to remove his own eye. Odin obliged and was gifted a drink from the well of knowledge. An interpretation of this story is that Odin had to sacrifice his eye in order to gain sight beyond what he can see. I believe that this name will strongly represent the spirit of the work undertaken on the research vessel. Researchers and research crew give a lot of themselves in the search for knowledge of what lies beneath the waters.

She is doing well almost a year later, but in that year, we have learned what a struggle this disease is, and how it forever changes everything a family is used to. I have two hopes: one being that this will bring a big smile to my daughter's face; the other that this will bring a greater awareness of Type 1 diabetes, so that we can get to either a cure, at least a more permanent treatment, sooner than later. It seems Type 2 diabetes dominates the drug adverts, the financial assistance offered, and is colloquially referred to as 'diabetes' when Type 1 and Type 2 are really two completely separate diseases, coincidentally with similar means of treatment. This would make a little girl (who coincidentally is half British) very happy. Then again, Boaty McBoatface would probably make her happy as well. Thanks for your consideration.

I am aware that she is not British but as the areas the ship will be exploring are devoted to discovery, not national identity, I do not think this should be regarded as a negative. Science belongs to everyone. I think that in the current times of terrorism and hostility across the world, I think it is more important than ever to look outside the island of Britain and to acknowledge the achievements of others.

Hubert Wilkins                |     0|1    |ZFG6sWWE|Terry Carolan        |Anyone who has read about the life and exploits of the Australian polar explorer Sir George Hubert Wilkins MC & Bar cannot fail to be astonished at how much this amazing man has crammed into one lifetime. And even more astonished at the lack of credit history affords him. Mostly due, it has to be said, to his unassuming lets-get-on-with-it attitude to life, while other (no less courageous) explorers were adept self-publicists. So unassuming was he in fact, that he chose to be 'Sir George' because he felt 'Sir Hubert' would detract from a previous famed Hubert. Although much of Wilkins polar exploration took him over (and under!) the Arctic ice, he was also the first human to explore much of Antarctica. An enlightened man for his time (or any time) I believe it is about time that the achievements of this remarkable man were given the recognition he deserves. And what better way than by naming a vessel of exploration after him? It just seems so fitting.

Dr Wilson - physician, scientist, explorer and artist, described by Scott as 'the finest character I have ever met' - married Oriana just three weeks before setting off for the Antarctic, his final words written to her in late March 1912,during the return journey from the South Pole, a testament to a sacrifice for science made without regret. Though grief-stricken, Oriana went on to make a name for herself during the First World War when she worked for the New Zealand Red Cross and was awarded a CBE for her services. As well as keeping to the tradition that ships are female, naming the polar research ship 'Oriana Wilson' would underline the scientific role for which this vessel is intended.

Also known as: Wind Eagle, Wind Bird A Native American weather spirit, Wuchowsen is a gigantic immortal bird spirit whose wings make the wind. Though a large and the winds he creates can be deadly, he is not treated as such in Wabanaki legends, but rather as a natural force of the world that must be respected. Such as sailors for generations have done before, those who take to the sea for any reason must show respect. To disrespect the Earth and her seas are essentially disrespecting Wuchowsen and putting themselves at danger. The crew of the new vessel will attempt to find the causes of the disrespect and the ensuing winds of destruction (which, technically take the form of storms, etc. as a result of climate changes).

The hardy and salty ship builder used the expression 'hite hawks' to refer generally to the guillimots, shags and gulls and other birds who were ever-present on the river. The origins of the word 'hite' is unclear, but is probably related to the Geordie saying 'hitey hinnies', referring to the crowds of ladies who waved the ships off on their maiden voyages from the banks of the river. I think the name RRS HITE HAWK will not only pay dues to the River Tyne and the Tynesiders who sent their great ships to all corners of the word, but will also the sea birds who fly alongside the boats as ever-present watchful companions.

He completed his 737 Challenge in a record setting 06 Months, 11 Days, 07 Hours and 53 Minutes and set a new benchmark in the climbing of the 7 summits. His 737 Challenge raised hundreds of thousands of pounds in aid of Marie Curie Cancer Care whilst creating an advertising value worth &pound;3 million to the cancer charity. In December 2012, he attempted to ski solo and unsupported to the South Pole from Hercules Inlet on the Antarctic coast. During his trek he received an extra food resupply, and in January he had to abandon the attempt as he could not reach the South Pole in time for the last plane back to South America. He returned to Antarctica at the end of 2013, and on 4 January 2014 he completed an unsupported and unassisted journey to the South Pole, covering 1,150 km (715 miles) in 29 days, 19 hours and 24 minutes, the fastest solo for a Brit.

Brumas, did much to bring our collective attention to Polar matters around the time we were beginning to comprehend just how valuable to us all the health of all regions on earth actually is. So I see the legacy of Brumas, as being of long lasting importance, and this vessel, deserves to reflect that importance, ' Brumas Legacy' is therefore a fitting name. Further, as an ex employee of Cammel Laird, who had the very great pleasure to help build the Windsor Castle, I extremely pleased to see the yard is still getting prestigious contracts that keep the name well to the forefront of world class shipbuilding.

He sailed on both of Captain Scotts expeditions, on the first in 1901 he saved the life of Captain Scott and on the second with his friend Tom Crean he saved the life of Captain Edward Evans. This earned both him and Tom the Albert Medal, he also holds the Polar Medal. He was one of the last people to see Scott alive and one of the first to enter the tent and find Scott and his companions. Llandk&ouml;nnu&eth;ur is I believe Icelandic for explorer.

It would be wonderful if this new ship was named Ambrose to commemorate him and all those who have lost their lives serving the British Antarctic Survey.

MATTHEW BRISBANE              |     0|0    |WIPS4xd8|Melanie Gilding      |Matthew Brisbane, in command of the Beaufoy, sailed with James Weddell further south in the southern oceans than had ever been done before (in 1823.) His strength of character, (he survived three shipwrecks!), and his seamanship, were held in high regard by Weddell, Fitzroy and James Clark Ross. After his murder by gauchos in the Falkland Islands (where I live) he was described by Fitzroy as 'an honest, industrious and most faithful man.........a man who feared no danger and despised hardships.' He had been ashore in South Georgia (where there is a Beaufoy Cove) and had ventured amongst the southern ice. That spirit of courage and adventure in the southern oceans, together with his excellent and respected reputation, not to mention his ability to survive in extreme situations, seem appropriate hopes and a good omen for a polar research vessel. It would keep the memory of such a great man alive. (It is also a reasonably easy name to say, and hear, over radio comms!)

Research is such an important part of our world. Its impact is tremendous on our everyday life. Because of research, we have so many scientific, medical and technological advances that were, once unpon a time, only found in the realms of science fiction and the imaginings of the human mind. Through research and development, these ideas and visions are now fact and they enhance our day to day lives. The launching of this new research ship into the polar region is another ground breaking and exciting step of research and discovery. This ship is the arrival, the emergence, the development of a new dawn in research in the polar regions.

Mimir's Abyssal Well          |     0|0    |n1b0qUSD|Katy Macpherson      |According to Norse mythology, the Norse God Odin was ever questing for Wisdom. Mimir (Mee-meer) (a god or giant), whose knowledge of all things was unparalleled among the inhabitants of the cosmos, achieved this status by taking his water from the well, whose waters impart this cosmic knowledge. Abyss is derived from the Greek word for 'bottomless'. I believe that this name would encapsulate the spirit of voyages she would undertake during her service time. Representing the quest for knowledge across the never ending, ever bottomless well of knowledge that she journeys across. Only ever skimming the surface of the secrets held below. Other suggestions would be Mimir's Abyss, Mimir's Abyssal Waters

He was part of the Elephant Island Expedition, following in the footsteps of one of his heroes, Shackleton. Alan was my father-in-law and one of the great gentlemen of this planet, Alan was the epitome of as he would say, 'a good egg'. However, he was also a bit of a prankster. During a trip South, he and a colleague photographed a plastic flower, then submitted it to The Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Southerly Flowering Plant. Alan was always there to listen. He would sit there, chewing on his pipe, cogitate and finally tell you in a thousand words (when 3 would do) his, usually correct, advice. It would be a fitting honour to a great man.

A WW2 Royal Navy Volunteer he lead HMS Ayrshire and 3 merchant ships, against orders, to safety in the arctic ice. This was part of the ill-fated PQ-17 Convoy in July 1942. Poor judgement by the Royal Navy High Command lead to the order 'Convoy is to scatter', German U-Boats and Luftwaffe aircraft swiftly sank 24 ships killing 153 allied mariners. Navigating his 4 ships with only a sextant and a Times Geographic World Pocket Book Gradwell lead the group into the arctic pack ice then used drums of white paint to camouflage the ships against German reconnaissance, the ploy worked and the men were later rescued. Prior to WW2 Gradwell had been a barrister and had no official Royal Navy training, only having a licence to pilot light sailing boats in coastal waters. I feel this man's incredibly bravery and ingenuity in the arctic should be recognised in naming this research ship RSS Gradwell.

I have always taken this story as being in part an allegorical representation of the historical as well as the contemporary scientific maritime heritage of humanity. This thematic interpretation of the human condition is a story of navigators of a powerful vessel, the Lookfar, who must knowingly lose sight of the certainties of shore and quite literally Lookfar past the horizons of their current understanding and explore across the ocean towards the Farthest Shore in order the understand the forces effecting their world.

He is known by the epithets L\u00e1mhfhada ([\u02c8la\u02d0wad\u032a\u02e0\u0259], meaning 'long arm' or 'long hand'), for his skill with a spear or sling, Ild\u00e1nach ('skilled in many arts'), Samhild\u00e1nach ('Equally skilled in many arts'), Lonnbeimnech ('fierce striker' or perhaps 'sword-shouter') and Macnia ('boy hero'), and by the matronymic mac Ethlenn or mac Ethnenn ('son of Ethliu or Ethniu').

Captain Francis Crozier FRS   |     0|1    |fpCRVZXs|Michael Johnston     |Captain Crozier was a valiant Arctic explorer and natural scientist, who sailed on many voyages to both Artic and Antarctic waters - as this new ship will do. Crozier conducted ground-breaking research on the Earth's magnetic field and its behaviour in the polar regions, for which he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society - an unprecedented achievement for a naval officer from a small town in Northern Ireland. Despite this honour, he otherwise never really received the recognition he should have. He was second-in-command of Sir John Franklin's ill-fated expedition to chart the North-West Passage, having to take over command when Sir John died. Crozier, and his crews, were lost in the Arctic ice, and their final resting place remains undiscovered. However, oral tradition among the inhabitants of that part of Canada identify Crozier as the 'last man standing'. Naming this ship after Crozier would recognise him as both explorer and a scientist, and honour the memory of him and his crews.

It is a wonder of evolution. Scott's middle name Falcon is a species of raptor found in every continent on earth except Antarctica. He changed that and his spirit and name remain there forever more. Any vessel in the sea is at the mercy of that very sea, a ship out of water so to speak. A desert falcon in the Arctic? Humility before the sea which knows no mercy with the strength and evolution of this most amazing bird.

Any team, no matter the field of study, requires flexibility in it's operation yet shows the resilience of mind to achieve the goals set out. Reverence in the ships name first and foremost implies the respect she should have of the ice; even if it her purpose to smash through it.

The species is strongly migratory, seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast for the southern summer and back again about six months later.

Snow Beagle                   |     0|0    |aR3UA3ja|Athos Athanasiou @athosfolk|Partly a reference to Charles' Darwin 5 year voyage of discovery on board the Beagle. But also a nod to A E Van Vogt's science fiction novel 'Voyage of the Space Beagle'. So the name is about looking back and looking forward at the same time. Darwin's voyage allowed us to better understand the wide diversity of life on Earth. Now as that diversity is under threat we need to better understand how this new world we have created works; How the oceans, the air, the land and all forms of life interact and depend on each other under current and future conditions, The arctic is an integral part of those functions and the 'snow' is to remind us of the most visible way the arctic is changing. As we lose more ice we lose more surface area that could reflect sunlight back out into space, affecting how temperature and pressure vary. The RRS Snow Beagle will be an important part of our efforts to piece together how our world is changing.

Shycroft                      |     0|0    |szNWTlxr|Karin Renner         |It stands for quiet strength without aggression, gentleness and passion, and perseverance in the face of obstacles. These are all qualities that are well suited for a research vessel: There is strength and passion in science but always with a view to the betterment of humankind. A ship sailing the polar waters must face obstacles but do so gently so as not to harm the already endangered ecosystem. She is a ship built for protection both inside and out: Protecting the crew and scientists from the elements who, in turn, are working to protect and study the marine flora and fauna and our environment. The name Shycroft represents all these qualities by combining 'shy' as an element of gentleness (etymologically, shy has referred to both strengths and weaknesses, just like gentleness can be seen as both - I prefer to see it as a strength) and 'croft' to represent home (home to the crew, but also working to preserve our home, Earth - chosen over the more obvious 'craft').

There are many theories but Hyperborea was basically Terra Incognita, and what is the ship for if not to investigate Terra Incognita? The Hyperboreans were a mythical people who lived 'beyond the north wind, in a perfect land where the sun shone 24 hours per day'. Sound familiar? Ok, so Hyperborea implies north, not south, but let us not split hairs over cartographical convention. 4. Unlike the unsavoury doings of mortal men, Hyperborea is unlikely to suddenly become subject to public opprobium when skeletons fall out of cupboards. I mean, Shackleton, great explorer and all but prone to charming money from rich old widows to fund his obsession. Nice. But whatever you name her, I wish your Polar vessel the best of luck.

A true pioneer, explorer and adventurer.

Rime                          |     0|0    |RQu83FyB|Dana Fisher @gemma__brown|[Taken from the wikipedia] Rime is a type of ice deposition that occurs quickly, often under conditions of heavily saturated air and windy conditions. Ships travelling through Arctic seas may accumulate large quantities of rime on the rigging. What is a more perfect name then the very name of the frosty\/snow accumulation on ships themselves? It has both a nautical context, as well as a wintery context, AND to top things off, rolls smoothly off the tongue.

Swallow's Tail                |     0|0    |SLtGX1qf|Nicholas  Swallow    |There are 4 key issues when deciding on a ship name. 1) Easy to remember 2) Distinctive 3) Can be pronounced easily over Radio both digital and VHF 4) Politics. With any famous or non-famous explorer there will be backlash from one interest group or another. Going non-human is simpler but can be a little obvious or result in names that are difficult for non-English speakers to understand over radio. The origin of 'Swallow's Tail' is related the dual fins as the wake from the powerful engines and props driving through the ice. It also acts a tribute to my Father John Swallow who spent a number of years serving in the Royal Navy in Artic and Icelandic waters.

Eidothea                      |     0|0,2  |chYsicJQ|Adam Cleverley       |In Greek mythology, Proteus (\/\u02c8pro\u028ati\u0259s, -tju\u02d0s\/;[1] Greek: &Pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;&epsilon;\u03cd&sigmaf;) is an early sea-god or god of rivers and oceanic bodies of water, one of several deities whom Homer calls the 'Old Man of the Sea'.[2] Some who ascribe to him a specific domain call him the god of 'elusive sea change', which suggests the constantly changing nature of the sea or the liquid quality of water in general. He can foretell the future, but, in a mytheme familiar to several cultures, will change his shape to avoid having to; he will answer only to someone who is capable of capturing the beast. From this feature of Proteus comes the adjective protean, with the general meaning of 'versatile', 'mutable', 'capable of assuming many forms'. 'Protean' has positive connotations of flexibility, versatility and adaptability.

Shelley                       |     0|0    |EbCbPaXY|Joe Roche @joeroche27|The 18 year old Mary Shelley's debut novel \"Frankenstein; Or the modern Prometheus\" opens with a narrative of arctic exploration. Captain Robert Walton is trapped\/becalmed in the ice when he discovers Victor Frankenstein chasing his creature across the sublime icy wastes. Walton is pushing the boundaries of research and science in his bid to explore the pole, in the same vein and spirit that the new NERC research ship will be operating.  In this light I believe \"Shelley\" to be an appropriate name, the mother of all science fiction who has subsequently inspired generations of writers, artists and scientists. The name is of course shared with her husband, the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley , thus honoring two of Britain's greatest writers whilst also sounding quite catchy!

In the 1970's the ruins were moved downstream of the dam to another island called Agilika before a much larger dam left the island of Philae forever submerged under Lake Nasser. The temple complex was in honour of the Egyptian God Isis and her pantheon Osiris and Horus. It is associated with the Greek empire's rule of Egypt in the Ptolemaic period in the time of Alexander the Great. When Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1923, the discovery was seen as symbolic of the imperial power of the British at that time, and parallels were drawn between King Tut's power and that of the British, especially given their dominion over Syria ('Feminist pharaoh Nefertiti one in the eye for ISIS', Ben Macintyre, The Times, Dec 4, 2015). And now Nefertiti may have been discovered in that same tomb...

From his initial involvement as the geologist on Shackleton's Endurance expedition to the many expeditions (eight) he organised to Arctic (undertaking significant scientific research) in the 1920 -1930s, some quarters believe that he kept Britain's interest in polar exploration alive during this period. He was also a mentor to a new generation of polar explorers including Vivian Fuchs and Gino Watkins amongst others and was regarded as the elder statesman of British polar exploration. Wordie was also Chairman of the Scott Polar Research Institute and President of the Royal Geographical Society. During the course of the second world war James Wordie aided in Operation Tabarin, which then morphed in to FIDS and lately the BAS. As this new ship is a polar and scientific vessel the RRS James Mann Wordie would be fitting name given his the legacy of polar scientific work.

Proteus                       |     0|0    |HgY61gx0|Simon Darby          |Proteus was an early sea-god or god of rivers and oceanic bodies of water. It also suggests the constantly changing nature of the sea or the liquid quality of water in general. This is particularly relevant bearing in mind the constantly changing state of the polar ice caps and annual melts. 'Protean' has positive connotations of flexibility, versatility and adaptability., which are all qualities that befit a Polar ice breaking ship. Legendary British world record breaker, Donald Campbell named his final land based vehicle, Bluebird-Proteus CN7 which he drove to break the world land speed record in 1964. All in all, I believe the name Proteus encapsulates the nature of the environment in which this vessel will operate, and invokes memories of valiant British pioneers who were not afraid to chase their dreams and push technology beyond its known limits, showing fortitude rarely seen these days.

This is Russell Coope's own description of what he found ... 'I happened, entirely by accident, to visit a Quaternary gravel pit in which were exposed the spectacular bones of mammoth, woolly rhinoceros and bison. Looking at their sediment matrix I was amazed to find enormous numbers of equally spectacular, if somewhat smaller, insect remains. I was hooked instantly! Particularly exciting to me was the fact that these insect fossils showed that Quaternary climates had changed abruptly. Thus, at times, fully glacial climates gave place to temperate interglacial conditions within the span of one human lifetime.' I had the good fortune to be a student in his palaeontology lectures long ago. In an interview in 2011, he said 'We are messing with the trigger that causes climate change....the outcome is likely to be ferocious.'

As the ship will explore and operate in polar regions this name seemed befitting its intended purpose. The use of the word glacies in latin also reflects its scientific contribution- as latin is often considered the language of science. The term Queen is suggested because this ship will be considered a flagship vessel and deserves a name befitting that status. Though the full latin name of Glaciem Regina (Ice Queen) could also have been used , by using the word Queen instead of regina this allows the people of the UK to better understand and relate to the name.

She saw service in the Falklands War, the Persian Gulf and Sierra Leone. Sadly, In 2009, she was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy, and renamed NDCC Almirante Saboia (G-25). But her service both to the military and RFA was exemplary. Sir Bevidere Was named after one of the 35 Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend who was also Cup Bearer to King Arthur. He was with Arthur at the Battle of Camlan where Arthur was fatally wounded. As he lay dying he commanded Sir Bedivere to throw his sword Excalibur as far as he could into a nearby stretch of water and when Sir Bedivere did so, the hand and arm of the Lady of the Lake came out, shook the sword 3 times and then vanished beneath the water.

Jane Franklin                 |     0|1    |HMA27VwR|Sylvie Pelletier     |Jane Franklin kept alive the memory of her spouse and Arctic explorer John Franklin who perished while pushing through the North-West Passage in 1845-1848. A rare woman to promote Arctic research, she financed several expeditions to the High Arctic in search of the Erebus and Terror, the two ships of her husband's expedition. Born in Tasmania and linked to Canada, her experience was global even before settling in London.. The strength and determination of Jane Franklin, her ability to organize complex voyages into the Arctic, her association with the principle Arctic explorations of her time, her inspirational female gender for a modern generation of Arctic scientists, her global experience, and the close identification of Native Inuit with the Franklin expedition, are the reasons for proposing her name for an Arctic research vessel.

This led to his accepting the position Geologist and Chief Scientific Advisor on Sir Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-1916). Later he was to become one the three founding fathers of Operation Tabarin (1943-1945) which became the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, part of the Colonial Office Development and Welfare vote created in Stanley, Falkland Islands. This was to become the Falkland Islands Dependencies Scientific Bureau in London, and then re-named the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1962. On the 1st April 1967 the BAS was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Natural Environment Research Council.
